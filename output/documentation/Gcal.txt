Gcal
****

This file documents 'gcal', a program for calculating and printing
calendars.

  Gcal displays hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendar
sheets, respectively, for one month, three months or a whole year.  It
also displays eternal holiday lists for many countries around the globe,
and features a very powerful creation of fixed date lists that can be
used for reminding purposes.  Gcal can calculate various astronomical
data and times of the Sun and the Moon for at pleasure any location,
precisely enough for most civil purposes.  Gcal supports some other
calendar systems, for example the Chinese calendar, the Hebrew calendar
and the civil Islamic calendar, too.

  This is Edition 4.1 of 'Gcal, an Extended Calendar Program',
24 June 2000, for the 4.1 version of the GNU implementation
of 'cal' and 'calendar'.

  Any suggestions, improvements, extensions, bug reports, donations,
proposals for contract work, and so forth are welcome!  Please send them

1 Preface
*********

The reason why I have written Gcal was mainly to have an _off-line_
tool(1) (*note Preface-Footnote-1::) which is able to display Julian and
Gregorian calendar sheets in a highly flexible and internationalized
manner, fixed date lists for reminding purposes and country respectively
territory specific holiday lists.  At a later stage, Gcal was extended
in the way to perform some basic astronomical calculations like Moon
phase, moonrise, moonset and other Moon based data, sunset, sunrise,
different twilight times and other Sun based data, zodiacal markers,
solar and lunar eclipses, equinoxes and solstices.  Other gimmicks like
biorhythm calculation and the computation of a distance between two
geographical point locations and their course angles (true tracks) are
also done by it now, plus a lot more.

  The accuracy of most of the astronomical calculations done by Gcal is
low because it is really hard to perform accurate astronomical
predictions more that 100 years ahead.  Of course, this also has
consequences for some country specific holidays which are based on such
astronomical calculations.  So it is really possible that some output
may differ from the real astronomical date and time of the event
calculated, and that by one or more minutes/hours/days.  This can happen
when the date of a real astronomical event occurs near around midnight.
So don't be surprised!  Strictly speaking, take all such astronomically
based output as a more or less good approximation of the true value, but
do not rely on it!

  Because Gcal is not primarily designed for the purpose of having a
high precision astronomical calculation tool, the world currently has to
live with these limitations.  But if *you* have C source code functions,
which

   * perform the astronomical calculations more precise for the period
     that is respected by Gcal,

   * have the similar or faster processing speed than Gcal's actual
     functions,

   * are either put into the public domain or are covered by the GPL(2)
     (*note Preface-Footnote-2::),

   * have the same calling conventions and return types like Gcal's
     actual functions,

   * conform to the GNU coding standard and are therefore easy to
     maintain and extend,

   * do not break Gcal internal limitations and concepts,

and you want to grant them to the public, I would be very pleased if you
would contact me so I am able to implement your result to a next release
of this software.

  Some words to the build-in country specific holidays now...

  As you certainly know, there are several other calendar systems
actually existing around the world among the Gregorian calendar.  The
Gregorian calendar that Gcal mainly represents as a software is only one
calendar of many others, but it is that one which is most respected
around the world today.  Even countries which use another calendar
system officially mostly respect the Gregorian calendar for civil and
administrative purposes.

  But when Gcal offers the ability to include holidays from a definite
country into its eternal holiday list, it is possible that not all
holidays are displayed which are respected in that country.  One reason
is that my various sources simply don't tell me about the existence of a
holiday.  A second reason is that the holiday is just designed or
changed or removed by political or society reality during Gcal's
development phase.  And another reason is that the method to calculate a
holiday is not build-in Gcal yet.  This case is marked by a '#'
character behind the country name in the list of countries, which are
respected by Gcal.  *Note Calendar option '--cc-holidays=CC[_TT][+...]':
x-cc-holidays, for the above mentioned list.
The holidays of "early" years that are included into the eternal holiday
list --i.e. those within the period AD 30 until the midth of the 20th
century-- are certainly not accomplishing the requirements of historians
to such a list.  Gcal cannot be understood as a complete and
historically correct data base, and it is not designed for that purpose!
This is caused by the fact that the territorial borders and names of the
national structures and the settlement in earlier times was partly quite
different as it is nowadays.  Moreover, I am yet lacking reliable
information that tells me the precise date of the introduction of a
holiday in a region.  Here I appeal to the historians to support me with
the concrete country and culture based data if they are bothered by this
fact and they want to have it removed.

  Still unsupported *alive* and *major* calendar systems, respectively
methods to derive country specific holidays from them, are:

   * Religious Islamic lunar calendar

   * Hindu solar and lunar calendars

   * Buddhist calendar

   * Sikh calendar

   * Jain calendar

  Even if the list of supported countries seems to be almost complete if
you compare it with the actual list of all nations existing around the
world, you should note that there are still some countries missing!  If
you can grant me support to complete Gcal's list of respected countries,
or if you would work out or have C functions which manage the missing
calendar systems, I also would be very pleased about if you would
contact me.

  I have recorded the country specific holiday dates as good as I can,
but I cannot guarantee that I did not made any mistakes while I hacked
them in.  So it is possible that some country specific holiday lists
contain errors.

  Well, if you think that I forgot to provide Gcal with the specific
holidays of a/your country, or you think that a country specific holiday
list is incomplete, or you think that some of the already implemented
holidays are wrong, please feel free to send me a complete list of all
the holidays which are celebrated in this country respectively to give
me hints how to correct or to complete them!

  Such a list should ideally include the following information:

   * The English name of the holiday.

   * The rule how it is built (like 10th October each year, or 47 days
     after Easter Sunday's date, or three Fridays before the last
     Saturday in June...).  If there are any exceptions from such a
     general rule, please state them in a detailed manner.  And please
     tell me the date since what time the holiday is or was celebrated
     for the first time, respectively.

     By the way, if the holiday is tied to the Easter Sunday's date,
     please tell me whether you mean the Easter Sunday of the Christian
     Western churches or the Easter Sunday of the Orthodox Christian
     Eastern churches.

   * Whether it is a "legal holiday" which is respected in the whole
     country.  (Use a '+' character for marking this case.)  In this
     sense, a legal holiday means a day people don't have to work -- as
     in most companies, and businesses are closed; like 'New Year's Day'
     on January 1st.

   * Whether it is a legal holiday in some parts of your country only.
     Please tell me whether such a holiday is valid in major parts of
     the country or not, try to express that by using percent points.
     (If such a holiday is celebrated in more than 70% of the country,
     use a '#' character for marking this case, otherwise use a '*'
     character.)

   * Whether it is a day only used for memorial or remembering purposes.
     (Use a '-' character for marking this case.)  Like 'All Fool's Day'
     on April 1st is not a holiday in the sense that anyone has a day
     off from school or work, just a _play jokes_ day, pretty ordinary.
     Other holidays may be celebrated with cards or presents etc. -- but
     they are working days such as:

          Valentine's day, Father's day, Mother's day.

  The Islamic holidays inserted into the country specific holiday list
are calculated arithmetically, not astronomically.  This is what people
call the "civil" Islamic lunar calendar.  This type of calendar is just
a rough estimate of the religious Islamic lunar calendar, which is
determined quite astronomically.  So don't be surprised too much if some
holiday dates differ from the religious Islamic calendar about +/- 1...2
days in some years.
The main difficulty to implement the religious Islamic calendar
correctly into Gcal are the several different criteria that are existing
for the first sighting of the crescent Moon after a New Moon phase --
that event, which defines the beginning of a new (lunar) month in the
religious oriented Islamic calendar.  So on the one hand, there are
quite astronomically-based criteria, and on the other hand, there are
also quite religiously-based criteria.  Furthermore, the local
predominant weather conditions, the geographical co-ordinate of the
observer's location and the kind of the observance method used also
affect these criteria.  Moreover, to render all more difficult, I as yet
do not have any reliable information that tells me which kind of
criteria is used in the countries (around 60 world-wide) which respect
this religious Islamic calendar.  So due to all the above mentioned
facts of problematic nature, this religious Islamic calendar is not
included into Gcal yet.

  The Chinese (and Japanese) holidays also inserted into the country
specific holiday list are calculated by using that algorithm as it is
used by the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing to determine the
astronomical lunisolar Chinese calendar.  This calendar is obligatory
for (the Peoples Republic of) China since 1929 and is determined
annually always new.  Nevertheless and strictly speaking, in the
historic reality and depending on the region, the Chinese calendar,
especially in the 17th and 18th century, was either calculated using
this _modern_ algorithm, or by the use of a different method, so that a
different calendar structure for one and the same year was possibly
calculated as result.

  And last...

  This manual shows the possible use of the Gcal program only briefly
and deliberately renounces to present the topics that are covered by
this software arranged in a novel-like style.  The use of Gcal is
illustrated in an exemplary manner only!  A detailed description of all
possible use is inexpedient here because there are simply too many of
such possibilities which are caused by the existing variety of
combinations of all useable modes of operation.

  Furthermore, this manual does not contain detailed explanations about
the calendar systems supported by Gcal, nor it can be understood as a
reference-book for the basics in celestial mechanics or spherical
trigonometry!  A detailed discussion of the above topics is completely
beyond the scope of this manual.  If you are interested to learn more
about these subjects, you unfortunately have to read the specific
pertinent literature.

  Any further errors occurring in the output of the above mentioned
holiday lists and in the astronomical calculations are my own fault, and
are not intended to offend members of any culture, religion or
profession!

2 Gcal Introduction
*******************

Apart from the usual and well known calendar functions like the output
of a month or a year calendar sheet, or the output of an eternal holiday
list, Gcal, the Gregorian calendar program of the Free Software
Foundation, offers the facility to display fixed dates on the day of
their occurrence and to remind or inform the user about them.  So it is
imaginable after booting the computer or starting the work session, that
the user is informed on screen or by means of electronic mail about all
holidays or appointments which are observed or scheduled for that day.

  The period, for which Gcal respects occurring fixed dates, may be
freely selected by the user.  So it is possible that Gcal displays all
fixed dates which occur on tomorrow's date, the whole week, the whole
month or in the whole year.  Fixed dates which occur on a selected date
of the year, and those that occur relative to another given date, are
displayed either related to this single date only, or in listed manner
starting on this date and ending on the actual date(1) (*note Gcal
Introduction-Footnote-1::).

  There are two methods to display a preview of fixed dates(2) (*note
Gcal Introduction-Footnote-2::) or retrospective view of fixed dates(3)
(*note Gcal Introduction-Footnote-3::).  On the one hand, Gcal can be
started by using an option that sets the system date of the computer to
the given date during the time of the program execution with the result,
the program assumes the system date is set to this given date and the
user can define any needed period that should be respected by an option.
On the other hand, Gcal can be started with a command which forces the
program to use a different year instead of the actual year, so Gcal will
display all occurring fixed dates for this particular year.  But this
limits the user in that it disables defining any needed period by an
option, because the period is always set to the whole year by default.

  Gcal isn't only able to display fixed dates which are stored for a
concrete date, e.g. 'Fixed date on 1st December 1995', rather than fixed
dates occurring periodically again and again.  So it is possible to
define repeated events like 'This fixed date occurs every day in May
1995' or 'Every 15th November in any years'.  These fixed date
definitions are stored in resource files and whenever Gcal is started,
an option to evaluate the necessary resource files can be given.

  Once the user has set his/her preferred command line arguments for
querying the fixed dates data base, it is possible to store them in a
response file or shell script file.  A response file contains all
arguments delivered to Gcal, but unlike a shell script file, such a
response file isn't executable; it is only a pool of command line
arguments which can be preloaded if needed.  A shell script file can be
started and calls Gcal directly with all arguments stored in it and all
arguments which are given further in the command line.

  A list of all usable command line arguments and their descriptions can
be found in the next chapter, which helps one to use Gcal in the most
efficient and productive way possible.  After it follows the description
how to use the eternal holiday list, and in the succeeding chapter, how
to use the fixed date list.  Comprehensive explanations respectively
summaries and tables to definite details or themes from other
disciplines can be found in the numerous appendices.

3 Invoking 'gcal'
*****************

Gcal is a command line oriented program.  It is usually called from the
"shell"(1) (*note Invoking Gcal-Footnote-1::) and processes given
arguments that are options and commands.  Options must be given before
commands, i.e. you must call Gcal like this:

           gcal [ [OPTION...] [%DATE] [@FILE...] ] [COMMAND]

  If Gcal is started without any options or commands, a calendar of the
current month is displayed.  If the calendar of a definite year is
wanted, the year must be fully specified, e.g. 'gcal 94' displays a year
calendar of the year 94, not of the year 1994.

  If two arguments are given in the command part, the *first* argument
denotes the month, and the *second* argument denotes the year.  In case
any incorrect commands are given running Gcal, the program will use
internal defaults.

  In the English program version, Gcal assumes the Gregorian Reformation
has occurred in 1752 on the 3rd of September.  *Note Genesis of the
Gregorian Calendar: Todays Calendar, and *note Aspects in
Internationalization: Internationalization, for further details.

   (1) This is an operating system program which interprets and runs
given command lines.

3.1 Command line arguments
==========================

This section describes all command line arguments processed by Gcal.
Four different types of command line arguments exists.  One important
type of arguments are the "options" which control how Gcal behaves.
Other types of arguments are the '%DATE' and the '@FILE' options.  The
'%DATE' option sets the period Gcal shall work on to any starting date;
the '@FILE' option preloads options and commands from a response file.
The most important arguments are the "commands" which control the
periods Gcal respects.

  An option is defined by a leading "switch" character; either the '-'
(dash) or the '/' (slash) character for traditional short-style options,
or '--' for mnemonic long-style options; a command may not have a
leading switch character.  Options(1) (*note Command line
arguments-Footnote-1::) *must* be given before commands!

  Depending on operating system and used shell, some of the arguments
and texts given in command line must be quoted by '"' or ''' characters
respectively protected or depreciated by a '\' character to avoid
expansion by the shell.

  Here is an incomplete list of characters which must potentially be
protected:

     '(', ')', '<', '>', '[', ']', '{', '}', '\', '|', '$', '@', '!',
     '&', '~', '"', ''', '`', ';'

   (1) Inclusive '%DATE' and '@FILE'.

3.1.1 Options
-------------

The options processed by Gcal can be grouped into four major option
classes.  The options of the "common option class" are the standard
options all GNU software should implement at least partially.  The
"global option class" contains options which affect the program output.
The options of the "calendar option class" control the calendar layout,
and the options of the "fixed date option class" control the fixed date
layout and intensity.

  Gcal supports both short-style options and GNU long-style options.
Traditional short-style options are indicated by a single switch
character, and trailed by the option character itself and perhaps a
modifier or an argument.  The most single character options(1) (*note
Options-Footnote-1::) can be composed into a single command line word:
'-Ax' is equivalent to '-A -x'.  GNU long-style options are indicated
with '--', and trailed by the mnemonic option name itself and perhaps an
argument.  Long-style options and their arguments may be abbreviated if
done unambiguously.  When a long-style option takes an argument, connect
the option name and the argument with '='.

  Brackets ([ and ]) indicate in the following tables, that an option
takes an optional argument.  The '|' character is used to separate
several arguments from each other.

  Gcal processes the GNU long-style options in a special, non-standard
way.  There are five different types of long-style options:

  1. '--foo'
     Enables option '--foo'.

  2. '--foo=BAR'
     Enables option '--foo' with the required argument BAR.

  3. '--foo[=BAR[|...|BAR]]'
     Option '--foo' may have one BAR argument.  If no argument list is
     given, any argument can be given to this option.  If an argument
     list is given, exactly one BAR argument may be selected from the
     given list.  If there is no argument chosen in this case, the first
     BAR argument of the argument list is preselected by default.

  4. '--foo=BAR|...|BAR'
     Option '--foo' requires exactly one BAR argument which must be
     selected from the given argument list.

  5. '--foo=BAR|...|BAR|BAZ'
     Option '--foo' requires exactly one BAR argument which must be
     selected from the given BAR argument list, or the alternative BAZ
     argument.

  Traditional short-style options differ as follows:

  1. '-x'
     Enables option '-x'.

  2. '-x BAR'
     Enables option '-x' with the required argument BAR.  The BAR
     argument may be separated by a leading _whitespace_ character from
     the short-style option character 'x'.  This means, the following
     notations are valid for giving an argument, namely '-x BAR' or
     '-xBAR'.

  3. '-x[BAR|...|BAR]'
     Option '-x' may have one or more BAR "modifier".  In this sense,
     modifiers are one or more characters which define a special mode of
     operation enabled by the '-x' option.  A modifier may not be
     separated by a leading _whitespace_ character from the short-style
     option character.

   (1) Unless they take an argument.

3.1.1.1 Common options
......................

'-?'
'-h'
'--help'
     Print a short usage message listing only some few of all available
     options, then exit successfully.

'-??'
'-hh'
'--usage[=ARGUMENT]'
'--long-help[=ARGUMENT]'
     Print an extended usage message listing all available options, then
     exit successfully.  If an ARGUMENT is given and it is a valid
     long-style option name, an extended help text related to the given
     long-style option name is displayed only, e.g.:

          --long-help=long-help

     displays the extended help text for the long option '--long-help'.

     If the ARGUMENT only consists of the single '?' character or is no
     valid long-style option name, a list of all valid long-style option
     names is displayed.

'-L'
'--license'
'--copyleft'
'--copyright'
     Print the software license message, then exit successfully.

'-V'
'--version'
     Print the version number and compilation options, then exit
     successfully.

'--exit-status-help-non-zero'
     Set the exit state of program to 127 instead to 0, if one of the
     other options of the _common option class_ is used.

3.1.1.2 Global options
......................

'-R NAME'
'--response-file=NAME'
     Write the contents of the environment variable 'GCAL' (*note
     Environment Variable 'GCAL': x-GCAL.), and then the arguments of
     command line (in the given order) to file NAME, i.e. create
     response file 'name'.  *Note Response file::, for more details.

'-S NAME'
'--shell-script=NAME'
     Write the contents of the environment variable 'GCAL' (*note
     Environment Variable 'GCAL': x-GCAL.), and then the arguments of
     command line (in the given order) to file NAME, i.e. create shell
     script file 'name'.  An automatically created shell script file is
     executable and calls Gcal directly with the arguments stored in it.
     You may start the shell script with other command line arguments
     which are directed to Gcal, too.

'--debug[=internal|handled|unhandled|all|abort]'
     Display some debug information.

     '--debug=internal'
          Display informational texts if program internal maxima are
          reached or other conditions occurred, respectively.

     '--debug=handled'
          Like '--debug=internal', additionally display the file names
          which can be processed respectively handled.

     '--debug=unhandled'
          Like '--debug=internal', additionally display file names which
          cannot be processed respectively handled.

     '--debug=all'
          Like '--debug=handled' and '--debug=unhandled' together.

     '--debug=abort'
          Like '--debug=all' and abort program with an error code if the
          file name cannot be handled or other unmanageable conditions
          occurred, respectively.  *Note Error Codes::.

'-p'
'--pager'
     Enables either an _external_ pager or a simple, _internal_ pager.
     If an environment variable 'PAGER' is set, its contents will be
     used for detecting the external pager program.  *Note Environment
     Variable 'PAGER': x-PAGER, for more information.

     If no 'PAGER' environment variable is set or if its contents is
     invalid, Gcal tries to use the 'less' pager; if this program cannot
     be found during scanning the 'PATH' environment variable, Gcal
     tries to use the 'more' pager, if this program cannot be found, the
     'pg' pager in the same way(1) (*note Global options-Footnote-1::).
     *Note Environment Variable 'PATH': x-PATH.

     If all these actions fail, Gcal will use its simple, built-in
     pager.  If the internal pager is used, Gcal detects the number of
     lines shown before it prompts and waits for user input by using
     these methods:

       1. Gcal respects the values set in the environment variables
          'GCAL_LINES' and 'GCAL_COLUMNS'.  *Note Environment Variable
          'GCAL_LINES': x-GCAL_LINES, and *note Environment Variable
          'GCAL_COLUMNS': x-GCAL_COLUMNS, for further information.

       2. If above action fails, Gcal respects the values set in the
          environment variables 'LINES' and 'COLUMNS'.  *Note
          Environment Variable 'LINES': x-LINES, and *note Environment
          Variable 'COLUMNS': x-COLUMNS, for more details.

       3. If above action fails, Gcal respects the values set in the
          'termcap'(2) (*note Global options-Footnote-2::) file which
          refers to the terminal used (*note Environment Variable
          'TERM': x-TERM.).  This step is only done on systems which
          support the use of Termcap by default.

          On MS-DOS, OS/2 and some other operating systems, Gcal uses a
          system dependent _low-level_ function and respects the
          reported values.

       4. If all above actions have failed, Gcal uses default values(3)
          (*note Global options-Footnote-3::).

'-H yes'
'--force-highlighting'
'--highlighting=yes'
     If the output of the program is redirected(4) (*note Global
     options-Footnote-4::) or piped(5) (*note Global
     options-Footnote-5::), the highlighting sequences are *not*
     automatically converted into the according marking characters, they
     remain unchanged.  This option takes no effect if the output of the
     program is sent by means of electronic mail.  *Note Global option
     '--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail.

'-H no'
'--disable-highlighting'
'--highlighting=no'
     Disable highlighting sequence / marking character pairs of current
     day, holiday or text explicitly.

'-H TEXT'
'--highlighting=TEXT'
     Set highlighting sequence / marking character pairs explicitly.  In
     this sense, "highlighting" sequences are control character
     sequences which cause a color or intensity switch in output text.
     Typical control character sequences are the ANSI escape sequences
     which have a leading escape character, and trailing more characters
     that define the type of the ANSI escape sequence.  In this sense,
     "marking" characters are single, printable characters which lead
     and trail the output text.

     The TEXT argument must be a (':') colon-separated text which is
     structured in this way: SEQ1_START:SEQ1_END:SEQ2_START:SEQ2_END.
     The *first* sequence is used for highlighting/marking an actual
     day, the *second* for a holiday.  The sequences must be given in
     form of a sequence pair; SEQ?_START enables the
     highlighting/marking, SEQ?_END disables it.  Only two sequence
     pairs will be processed, others are ignored.  Either highlighting
     sequence pairs or marking character pairs may be defined, i.e.
     using them both in a mixed couple is not permitted!

     For example:

          '-H \x20:\x20:\x1:#' respectively
          '--highlighting=\x20:\x20:\x1:#'
          marks the actual day like '\x20ACTUAL DATE\x20'(6) (*note
          Global options-Footnote-6::) and the holiday date like
          '\x1HOLIDAY DATE#' using the given marking characters.

          '-H \x1b[34;42m:\x1b[0;40m' or
          '-H \033[34;42m:\033[0;40m' or
          '-H \E[34;42m:\E[0;40m'
          defines a starting ANSI escape highlighting sequence
          '\x1b[34;42m' used for actual day and ending ANSI escape
          highlighting sequence '\x1b[0;40m' with no given highlighting
          sequence for holidays, so default highlighting sequences for
          holidays are used (non-given entries are always skipped).
          Please note the last abstract of this text part which informs
          you more detailed of this context.  *Note Environment Variable
          'GCALANSI': x-GCALANSI, too.

     Control code definitions may contain any printable characters.
     Non-printable characters may be encoded in octal or hexadecimal
     notation.  The abbreviation '\E' directly encodes the escape
     character (octal '\033' respectively hexadecimal '\x1B').

     A character can be encoded octal by typing '\NNN'
     (backslash-octal digit(s)), where N must be a valid octal digit
     (0...7).  Normally, three octal digits must be given.  If the octal
     character code consists of one or two octal digits, leading zeroes
     must be added, except the case, where the encoded octal character
     is given at last in the single sequence.

     A character can be encoded hexadecimal by typing '\xNN'
     (backslash-x hexadecimal digit(s)), where N must be a valid
     hexadecimal digit (0...9A...Fa...f).  Normally, two hexadecimal
     digits must be given.  If the hexadecimal character code consists
     of one hexadecimal digit, a leading zero must be added, except the
     case, where the encoded hexadecimal character is given at last in
     the single sequence.

     If the sequence separator character, thus the ':' (colon) character
     itself, is used as a marking character, it must be encoded either
     octal by '\072' or hexadecimal by '\x3A'.

     If the C Preprocessor symbol 'USE_PAGER' was defined and the output
     of the program is redirected or used in a pipeline, the
     highlighting sequences are automatically converted into the
     according marking characters; if 'USE_PAGER' was not defined, they
     remain untouched.

     Incomplete or non-given highlighting sequences will be replaced by
     internal default ANSI escape highlighting sequences if a 'GCALANSI'
     environment variable is defined; otherwise completely replaced by
     their according marking characters.  *Note Environment Variable
     'GCALANSI': x-GCALANSI.

'--mail[=ADDRESS]'
     Send Gcal's output via 'mail'(7) (*note Global
     options-Footnote-7::) program to the given ADDRESS, e.g.:

          --mail=esken@gmx.net

     If no ADDRESS is given, Gcal tries to send the eMail by using the
     following methods:

       1. If an environment variable 'MAILTO' is defined and set, the
          eMail is send to the address which is listed in this
          environment variable.  *Note Environment Variable 'MAILTO':
          x-MAILTO, for more information.

       2. If above action fails, and if an environment variable 'USER'
          is defined and set, the eMail is send to the address which is
          listed in this environment variable.  *Note Environment
          Variable 'USER': x-USER, for more information.

       3. If above action fails, and if an environment variable
          'LOGNAME' is defined and set, the eMail is send to the address
          which is listed in this environment variable.  *Note
          Environment Variable 'LOGNAME': x-LOGNAME, for more
          information.

       4. If all above actions have failed, no eMail is send.

     Generally, Gcal does not send electronic Mails whose message body
     is empty!  An informational message will be shown on the _standard
     error channel_ if this case occurs.

     All highlighting sequences produced by Gcal itself are always
     disabled respectively automatically converted into the according
     marking characters if an eMail must be send; no matter if the
     '--force-highlighting' option was given or not.  This behavior of
     Gcal is an imperative necessity, because it is possible that the
     'mail' program cannot perform the mailing correctly.  Please pay
     attention in this context to the further explanations concerning
     the limitations of the _text part_ of a resource file line (*note
     Text part of a line::).

     If an environment variable 'MAILPROG' is defined and set, its
     contents will be used as the program name of the mailer instead of
     the standard name 'mail'.  *Note Environment Variable 'MAILPROG':
     x-MAILPROG, for more information.

   (1) See the standard manual pages for 'less', 'more' and 'pg'.

   (2) See the standard manual pages for Termcap.

   (3) Either 23 or 24 lines, and 80 columns.

   (4) This means, sent to another device.

   (5) This means, used as an input data stream for another program.

   (6) This means with a leading and a trailing blank.

   (7) See the standard manual pages for 'mail'.

'-O'
'--orthodox-calendar'
     Use the leap year rule as used by the Eastern Orthodox churches.

     Without specifying the '--orthodox-calendar' option, Gcal is unable
     to display Gregorian years later than 2799 in the correct way for
     the Eastern churches, because they use a different scheme for
     calculating the leap years.  The method for computing leap years
     within the common Gregorian calendar, which Gcal uses by default,
     is as follows:

          A leap year is any year which number can be divided by 4
          without a remainder, and years ending in hundreds are no leap
          years unless they are divisible by 400.

     But the Eastern Orthodox churches compute leap years within the
     Gregorian calendar by using another rule:

          A leap year is any year which number can be divided by 4
          without a remainder, and years ending in hundreds are leap
          years, if a remainder of 2 or 6 occurs when such a year is
          divided by 9.

     The first difference therefore occurs in the year 2800 which is a
     leap year in the common Gregorian calendar, but an ordinary year
     only in the calendar as used by the Eastern Orthodox churches.

     '--iso-week-number=yes'
          The methods of the ISO-8601:1988 are used for detecting week
          numbers; this means a week starts on Mondays, and the first
          week of a year is the one which includes the first Thursday;
          equivalently, the one which includes the 4th January.  This
          method is called "ISO week number" in the further context.  If
          the starting day of the week is not set to Monday, the week
          numbers are not represented correctly in most cases.  If you
          use this option, you should take care of setting Monday as the
          starting day of the week!

     '--iso-week-number=no'
          Weeks start on the respective starting day of the week, and
          the days in a new year that are preceding the first starting
          day of the week are in the last week of the previous year,
          respectively in week zero of the new year.  This method is
          called "standard week number" in the further context.

'-u'
'--suppress-calendar'
     Suppress output of calendar sheet explicitly.

'-b NUMBER'
'--blocks=NUMBER'
     Set NUMBER of calendar sheet blocks (valid arguments:
     '1|2|3|4|6|12').  The default NUMBER for the _standard calendar
     format_ is '-b4 ' respectively '--blocks=4', and for the _special
     calendar format_ '-b 3' respectively '--blocks=3'.  If this option
     is found, the program sees that a year calendar output is desired!

     '-b 1'
     '--blocks=1'
          Displays one block with twelve months at a time.

     '-b 2'
     '--blocks=2'
          Displays two blocks with six months at a time.

     '-b 3'
     '--blocks=3'
          Displays three blocks with four months at a time.

     '-b 4'
     '--blocks=4'
          Displays four blocks with three months at a time.

     '-b 6'
     '--blocks=6'
          Displays six blocks with two months at a time.

     '-b 12'
     '--blocks=12'
          Displays twelve blocks with one month at a time.

'-j[b]'
'--calendar-dates=special|both'
     Use alternative date format in calendar sheet instead of the
     default standard format which displays the days of month in
     consecutive manner.

     '-j'
     '--calendar-dates=special'
          Display the calendar sheet by using the special date format.
          This means, the days of year are displayed in consecutive
          manner instead of the days of month.

     '-jb'
     '--calendar-dates=both'
          Display the calendar sheet by using both the standard date
          format and special date format.

'-jn[b]'
'--holiday-dates=special|both'
     Use alternative date format in eternal holiday list instead of the
     default standard format which displays the days of month in
     consecutive manner.  *Note Calendar option
     '--holiday-list[=long|short]': x-holiday-list.

     '-jn'
     '--holiday-dates=special'
          Display the eternal holiday list by using the special date
          format.  This means, the days of year are displayed in
          consecutive manner instead of the days of month.

     '-jnb'
     '--holiday-dates=both'
          Display the eternal holiday list by using both the standard
          date format and special date format.

'-jc[b]'
'--fixed-dates=special|both'
     Use alternative date format in fixed date list instead of the
     default standard format which displays the days of month in
     consecutive manner.  *Note Fixed date option
     '--list-of-fixed-dates[=short|long]': x-list-of-fixed-dates.

     '-jc'
     '--fixed-dates=special'
          Display the fixed date list by using the special date format.
          This means, the days of year are displayed in consecutive
          manner instead of the days of month.

     '-jcb'
     '--fixed-dates=both'
          Display the fixed date list by using both the standard date
          format and special date format.

'-s ARGUMENT'
'--starting-day=ARGUMENT'
     Set the starting day of the week (valid ARGUMENT:
     '0, 1...7 | today | WEEKDAY NAME').

     For example:

          --starting-day=Sunday or
          --starting-day=7 or
          -s SUNDAY or
          -s sund or
          -sSu or
          -s 7

     thus all specifies the Sunday (1==Mon, 2==Tue ... 7==Sun).

     If the '-s today' option (or '--starting-day=today') or the '-s 0'
     option (or '--starting-day=0') is given, the starting day of the
     week is set to the actual weekday as it is delivered by the system
     date.  *Note Aspects in Internationalization: Internationalization,
     for more details.

'--time-offset=ARGUMENT'
     Change the base time of the astronomical functions (valid ARGUMENT:
     't|@|[t|@][+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]').

     If no '--time-offset=ARGUMENT' option is given, the astronomical
     data that is inserted into the eternal holiday list by the
     '--astronomical-holidays' option (*note Calendar option
     '--astronomical-holidays': x-astronomical-holidays.), and all Sun
     and Moon related special texts are always calculated for 0 o'clock
     Universal time (UTC/GMT), thus "civil midnight time".

     *Note Sun data::, and *note Moon data::, likewise *note Moon
     phase::, for further information.

     The ARGUMENT is either the 't' or the '@' character --where 't'
     means a relation to the actual local time(3) (*note Calendar
     options-Footnote-3::) and '@' denotes a relation to the actual
     Universal time--, or one of these characters followed by a
     displacement value, or only a displacement value which has to be
     specified either by using the '[+|-]MMMM' format or the
     '[+|-]HH:[MM]' format.  '[+|-]MMMM' adds respectively subtracts the
     specified amount of minutes MMMM from the base time value 0 o'clock
     Universal time (range '0...9999'), while '[+|-]HH:[MM]' adds
     respectively subtracts the given amount of hours HH (range
     '0...99') and minutes MM (range '0...59') from the base time value
     0 o'clock Universal time.  The displacement value is always added
     to the base time value 0 o'clock Universal time in case it is
     specified without a '+|-' sign.

     For example, the '--time-offset=+1:' option causes that while
     displaying eternal holiday lists and fixed date lists, the time 0
     o'clock of the timezone GMT-1 (== CET) is used as the base time by
     the astronomical functions instead of the base time 0 o'clock
     Universal time (== GMT).

     For example, the '--time-offset=t-2:' option causes that while
     displaying eternal holiday lists and fixed date lists, the time
     that is two hours earlier than the actual local time is used as the
     base time by the astronomical functions instead of the base time 0
     o'clock Universal time (== GMT).  For such a kind of relation, the
     term "relative time offset value" will be used in the further
     context.

'--transform-year=ARGUMENT'
     Change the base year of calendar (valid ARGUMENT:
     '-9999...[+]9999').

     For example, the '--transform-year=-543' option causes that while
     displaying calendar sheets, eternal holiday lists and fixed date
     lists, the year 543 BC is used as the base year of the calendar
     instead of the year AD 1.  This results in the case that --for
     example-- for the year 1999 (Christian era), the year number 1999
     is not used in the above mentioned outputs, but the year number
     2542 which is used in the western oriented Thai calendar.

     Nevertheless, Gcal does not respect the '--transform-year=ARGUMENT'
     option when using the actual date modifier '%DATE' (*note Actual
     date modifier::), the commands (*note Commands::), and the fixed
     date entries in a resource file (*note Date part of a line::).
     There, all references made to a definite year are always treated in
     the way that the year AD 1 is the base year of the calendar, so in
     fact it is *only* possible to use references based on the Christian
     era.

'--gregorian-reform=1582|1700|1752|1753|ARGUMENT'
     Set the period which was skipped during the Gregorian Reformation.
     By default, Gcal runs in the "hybrid" calendar mode, i.e. Gcal
     automatically changes from the Julian calendar system to the
     Gregorian calendar system if output is related to dates after the
     Gregorian Reformation has happened.  *Note Aspects in
     Internationalization: Internationalization, for more details.
     Actually, four fixed default periods are supported, and that of the
     year 1582, of the year 1700, of the year 1752 and of the year 1753.

     If Gcal is called with the '--gregorian-reform=1582' option, it
     assumes the Gregorian Reformation has occurred from 5th till 14th
     October 1582.

     If Gcal is called with the '--gregorian-reform=1700' option, it
     assumes the Gregorian Reformation has occurred from 19th till 28th
     February 1700.

     If Gcal is called with the '--gregorian-reform=1752' option, it
     assumes the Gregorian Reformation has occurred from 3rd till 13th
     September 1752.

     If Gcal is called with the '--gregorian-reform=1753' option, it
     assumes the Gregorian Reformation has occurred from 18th till 28th
     February 1753.

     In case another period shall be respected, it can be arranged by
     the option ARGUMENT like 'YYYYY,MM,FIRST-DAY,LAST-DAY'.  If the
     Gregorian Reformation has occurred for example on the 7th till the
     17th April 1802, this can be arranged as follows:

          --gregorian-reform=1802,4,7,17

     Gcal is able to represent so-called "proleptic" calendars of a
     definite calendar system.  This means, Gcal only uses a definite
     calendar system during a definite period, although there was a
     change to another calendar system in the historic reality during
     this definite period.  The following proleptic calendar systems are
     actually supported by Gcal:

        * Proleptic Gregorian calendars can be created from AD 302 until
          AD 9999 if '--gregorian-reform=301,12,31,31' is used.
          Unfortunately, Gcal actually cannot represent years before AD
          302 in a proleptic-Gregorian manner.

        * Proleptic Julian calendars can be created from AD 1 until AD
          9999 if '--gregorian-reform=10002,12,31,31' is used.  In this
          case, the actual system date that is normally based on the
          Gregorian calendar and that is used by Gcal, is internally and
          automatically converted into the according Julian date(4)
          (*note Calendar options-Footnote-4::).  The same happens if
          the actual system date is modified by using the actual date
          modifier '%DATE'.  In such a case, Gcal also assumes that the
          given date is a Gregorian date, and converts it automatically
          into the according Julian date internally.  *Note Actual date
          modifier::, for further details.

     Please note that it is possible to corrupt the calendars likewise
     the fixed date feature logically (which works correctly now for the
     year in which the Gregorian Reformation has occurred) if the
     argument of the '--gregorian-reform' option is not used with care.

'--date-format=de|us|gb|TEXT'
     Set the date format which affects the ordering and representation
     of a displayed date.  *Note Aspects in Internationalization:
     Internationalization, for more details.  The date format text is
     respected by Gcal in the eternal holiday list, in the fixed date
     list and the calendar sheets.  Moreover, Gcal internally tries to
     obtain the best representation of a displayed date in case the
     day-of-year numbers instead of the day-of-month numbers must be
     displayed, or both types of numbers are used in a combined manner.

     Actually, three fixed default date formats are supported, and that
     for German users, U.S. American users and for users in Great
     Britain.

     If Gcal is called with the '--date-format=de' option,
     the '%<2#K,  %1%>2*D%2 %<3#U %>04*Y' date format text is used.
     This result in that a date is displayed by using the
     'WW,  DD MMM YYYY' ordering, for example 'Sa,  28 Aug 1999'.

     If Gcal is called with the '--date-format=us' option,
     the '%<3#K, %<3#U  %1%>2&*D%2 %>04*Y' date format text is used.
     This result in that a date is displayed by using the
     'WWW, MMM  DD YYYY' ordering, for example 'Sat, Aug  28th 1999'.

     If Gcal is called with the '--date-format=gb' option,
     the '%<3#K,  %1%>2&*D%2 %<3#U %>04*Y' date format text is used.
     This result in that a date is displayed by using the
     'WWW,  DD MMM YYYY' ordering, for example 'Sat,  28th Aug 1999'.

     In case another format text shall be respected, this format text
     can either be set in the 'GCAL_DATE_FORMAT' environment variable(5)
     (*note Calendar options-Footnote-5::), or it can be arranged by the
     option argument TEXT.  For example,
     '--date-format='%Y %D %>02*M ; %1(%>5u#K)%2'' displays a date by
     using the '[[[Y]Y]Y]Y [D]D MM ; (WWWWW)' ordering, thus for example
     '1999 28 08 ; (SATUR)'.  *Note Environment Variable
     'GCAL_DATE_FORMAT': x-GCAL_DATE_FORMAT, for further information.

     The format text may contain on the one hand all characters which
     can be managed by Gcal, and on the other hand character replacement
     instructions and format elements which are transformed into their
     according values at run-time.  Some format elements may have a
     format instruction which is called FORMAT in the further context.
     *Note Format Instruction::, for the detailed description of the
     format instruction and its components.

     A minimum date format text must contain the following format
     elements minimum:

          The day number, one component of the month group, the year
          number and both components of the highlighting group.

     A weekday name format element may be included optionally into the
     date format text.  The following format elements and character
     replacement instructions are currently supported:

     '%[FORMAT]D'
          Day number (must be defined)

     '%[FORMAT]Y'
          Year number (must be defined)

     '%[FORMAT]K'
          Weekday name (may be defined)

     Month group (exactly one member must be defined):

     '%[FORMAT]M'
          Month number

     '%[FORMAT]U'
          Month name

     Highlighting group (all members must be defined and '%1' must be
     specified before '%2'):

     '%1'
          Start of highlighting sequence / marking character

     '%2'
          End of highlighting sequence / marking character

     Character replacement instructions:

     '_'
          Space/blank character ' '

     '\_'
          Underscore character '_'

     '\%'
          Percent character '%'

     '\\'
          Backslash character '\'

     *Note Table of Obsolete Date Formats::, and *note Table of Obsolete
     Date Format Elements::, for further information.

'--translate-string=TEXT'
     Define the country specific special character pairs which are
     respected or translated by a STYLE format instruction component,
     respectively.  *Note Format Instruction::, for the detailed
     description of the format instruction and its components.  The
     country specific special character pairs are arranged by the TEXT
     option argument as a sequence of single character pairs, and that
     in any number and order.  The upper-case representation of the
     country specific special character has to be specified at first,
     and after that its lower-case representation.  Country specific
     special characters which do not have an upper-case resp.,
     lower-case representation in the character set used, like e.g. the
     'ss'-character which is very usual in the German character set, are
     also specified as a special character pair (here: 'ssss'),
     otherwise these special characters are not recognized and they are
     converted incorrectly by the STYLE format instruction component.
     In case the lower-case representation of the country specific
     special character is specified at first, and after that its
     upper-case representation, this option does not cause any further
     affects to the STYLE format instruction component; resulting, the
     country specific special characters specified are not recognized as
     such and they remain untranslated therefore.

     For example, a 'A"a"O"o"U"u"ssss' option argument causes the
     correct conversion of the preceding special characters in an
     individual date format, which has a STYLE format instruction
     component, and that, how they are used by the character set used in
     Germany.

   (1) ISO is the abbreviation of 'International Organization for
Standardization'.

   (2) Similar the BSD-'cal' program.

   (3) The time which is set as system time in the computer's clock.

   (4) The automatical conversion into the according Julian date is
always done if the actual system date, that is based on the Gregorian
calendar, is before the date of the Gregorian Reformation.

   (5) But 'GCAL_DATE_FORMAT' is only used in case no
'--date-format=de|us|gb|TEXT' option is given.

3.1.1.4 Fixed date options
..........................

'-v ARGUMENT'
'--date-variable=ARGUMENT'
     Define "global" date variable which is visible in all referenced
     resource files (*note Date variables::).  The option ARGUMENT must
     either be a valid single date variable definition or a (':')
     colon-connected series of definitions.

     A date variable name DVAR consists of a single, case-insensitive
     letter(1) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-1::).  In a
     definition, this name is trailed by the assignment operator
     character '=', and the numerical values of month MM (or a short,
     three characters month name, e.g. 'Jan', 'Feb'...) and day DD, this
     variable has to store(2) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-2::).

     For example:

          '--date-variable=a=1127:c=a' respectively
          '-v a=1127:c=a'
          stores the 27th November into the global date variable A and
          into the global date variable C.

'--export-date-variables'
     Causes the export of local date variables from one resource file to
     another resource file.  *Note Date variables::, for more details.

'-r ARGUMENT'
'--text-variable=ARGUMENT'
     Define "global" text variable which is visible in all referenced
     resource files (*note Text variables::).  The option ARGUMENT must
     either be a valid single text variable definition or a (':')
     colon-connected series of definitions.

     A text variable name TVAR consists of the '$' prefix and a single,
     case-insensitive letter.

     A text variable is defined as follows:

        * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
          operator character '=', all the text which appears at the
          right side of this assignment operator is assigned to this
          text variable.

        * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
          operator character '?', all the text which appears at the
          right side of this assignment operator is assumed as an
          external command and executed by Gcal.  The output, which is
          created on the _standard output channel_ by the command run,
          is assigned to this text variable; and that in an interpreted
          manner.  This means, Gcal interprets all special texts and
          references to other text variables which are contained in this
          output.  *Note Text variables::, and *note Special Texts
          processed::, for further information.

        * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
          operator character ':', all the text which appears at the
          right side of this assignment operator is assumed as an
          external command and executed by Gcal.  The output, which is
          created on the _standard output channel_ by the command run,
          is assigned to this text variable; and that in an
          uninterpreted manner.  This means, Gcal does not interpret any
          special texts and references to other text variables which are
          contained in this output.  See also *note Text variables::,
          and *note Special Texts processed::, for further details.

     Indeed, Gcal executes external commands only if the
     '--execute-command' option is given at program start-up.  *Note
     Fixed date option '--execute-command': x-execute-command, for more
     details.

     The text which appears at the right side of one of the valid
     assignment operator characters may reference names of already
     defined global text variables.  These references are converted to
     the according textual values just before the assignment is
     performed by Gcal.

     A global text variable is defined with an _empty contents_ in case
     no text appears at the right side of one of the valid assignment
     operator characters.

     For example:

          '--text-variable=$a=foo:$c=$a' respectively
          '-r $a=foo:$c=$a'
          stores the 'foo' text into the global text variable $A and
          into the global text variable $C.

          '--text-variable=$a\:foo:$c?bar' respectively
          '-r $a\:foo:$c?bar'
          stores the uninterpreted output of the 'foo' command into the
          global text variable $A, and the interpreted output of the
          'bar' command into the global text variable $C.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the ':' separator
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\:'.  If you need the
     '\:' characters themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash)
     character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\:'.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '$' prefix character
     --in case this character itself is needed in the text-- by placing
     a '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\$'.  If you need the
     '\$' characters themselves in the text, you have to protect the '\'
     (backslash) character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g.
     '\\$'.

     Each time a '_' (underscore) character is found in ARGUMENT, this
     character is replaced by a real ' ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\_'.  If you need the
     '\_' themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash) character
     by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\_'.

'--export-text-variables'
     Causes the export of local text variables from one resource file to
     another resource file.  *Note Text variables::, for more details.

'--adjust-value=ARGUMENT'
     Causes on the one hand, that the number given as ARGUMENT to the
     '--adjust-value' option is used as reference altitude to calculate
     the rise and set times by the Sun and Moon oriented special texts.
     The option argument must be a rational number in range
     -90.0...+90.0, which declares the angle distance in decimal degrees
     from the center of astronomical object to the horizon.  For
     example, you can detect the time when the center of the Sun or the
     Moon is 20.5 decimal degrees below the horizon if you use
     '--adjust-value=-20.5'.

     And causes on the other hand, that the number that is given as
     ARGUMENT is used as factor for computing the shadow length of a
     vertical pole by the Sun oriented special texts.  The option
     argument must be a rational number in range 0.0...+90.0, which
     declares the shadow length.  For example, you can detect the time
     when the shadow length of vertical pole is three and a half times
     longer than the shadow length that appears at astronomical noon if
     you use '--adjust-value=3.5'.

     *Note Sun data::, and *note Moon data::, for further information.

'--atmosphere=AIR-PRESSURE[,TEMPERATURE]'
     Set the base data of the Earth's atmosphere that is necessary to
     calculate the amount of "refraction"(3) (*note Fixed date
     options-Footnote-3::), that is used by the Sun and Moon oriented
     special texts.  The option argument consists of one or two rational
     numbers, which are separated by a ',' character.  The first number
     denotes the air pressure in millibar, and the second number
     specifies the air temperature in degree Celsius.  The default value
     for the air pressure is 1013.25 millibar, and the default value for
     the temperature is 15.0 degree Celsius.  For example, if you use
     '--atmosphere=1010,10', you define atmospheric conditions as they
     are existing for an air pressure of 1010 millibar and a temperature
     of 10 degree Celsius.  If you set an air pressure value less or
     equal zero, no atmospheric refraction will be respected by the Sun
     and Moon oriented special texts, as for example done by
     '--atmosphere=0'.

'--limit'
     Causes when calculating the rise and set times by the Sun oriented
     special texts for high latitudes, that a rise or set event which
     possibly occurs on a previous or next day, is not displayed as
     occurring on the actual day as it is done by default.  At high
     latitudes, i.e. above the solar Arctic Circle, it is fact that no,
     or more than one sunrise or sunset happens during a day at definite
     dates of the year.  As a special text basically leads in a single,
     atomical output, even it should result in several output in
     reality, Gcal puts such an event on a previous or next day.  Then,
     data represented in this manner could be misinterpreted very
     easily.

     The following example is used to explain this.  It calculates the
     time the astronomical twilight ends for the location Mu"nster,
     Germany, during some days in May 2000, and that with and without
     the '--limit' option in each case:

          $ gcal %20000506 -f/dev/null -cxl4+ \
          >      -#'0*d1#999_%s9+5158+00738,120'
          -|
          -| Sun, May   7th 2000: 23:52
          -| Mon, May   8th 2000: 23:57
          -| Tue, May   9th 2000: 00:01
          -| Wed, May  10th 2000: 00:06
          $ gcal %20000506 -f/dev/null -cxl4+ --limit \
          >      -#'0*d1#999_%s9+5158+00738,120'
          -|
          -| Sun, May   7th 2000: 23:52
          -| Mon, May   8th 2000: 23:57
          -| Tue, May   9th 2000: **:**
          -| Wed, May  10th 2000: **:**

     As one can see well in the above example, the output for the days
     since 9th May differs in that the times shown without the '--limit'
     option obviously exceeded the civil midnight time and actually
     cannot happen during these days, whereas no times are shown for the
     days since 9th May if the '--limit' option is used because the time
     circle is exceeded.  Astronomically seen, it is the case that the
     end of the astronomical twilight is at 23:57 o'clock local time on
     8th May, no end of astronomical twilight happens on 9th May because
     the center of the Sun's disk is always above 18 degrees (the
     reference altitude of the astronomical twilight) below a geometric
     horizon, but on 10th May at 00:01 o'clock local time, this
     reference altitude is passed again.  Thus, the time that is
     detected for the 9th May has properly to be moved to the 10th May,
     et cetera, as it is expressed by the output that is created by
     using the '--limit' option.

     *Note Sun data::, for further information.

'--cycle-end=ARGUMENT'
     Calculates the Sun and Moon oriented special texts that are
     dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective clocktime, for a series
     of clocktimes for the current day, i.e. determination is done for
     any time interval that can be individually defined by the user.
     Gcal is always put into such a "cycle mode" if the '--cycle-end'
     option is given at program start-up.  The ARGUMENT of the
     '--cycle-end' option is syntactically according to the argument
     which may be given to the '--time-offset' option, thus
     't|@|[t|@][+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]'.  *Note Calendar option
     '--time-offset=ARGUMENT': x-time-offset, for the detailed
     explanation of the preceding option argument.  Thus, the
     '--cycle-end' option is used to fix the ending time of the time
     interval, whereas the '--time-offset' option is *implicitly* used
     to fix the starting time of the time interval, that is 0 o'clock by
     default(4) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-4::).

     If values for the time interval are given to both above mentioned
     options that fall short of 0 o'clock, these values are
     automatically set to 0 o'clock.  If values for the time interval
     are given that exceed 23:39 o'clock, these values are automatically
     set to 23:59 o'clock.

     The timestep value between the starting and the ending time of the
     time interval that is respected by Gcal is one minute by default.
     This value can at pleasure be changed by using the '--cycle-step'
     option.  *Note Fixed date option '--cycle-step=ARGUMENT':
     x-cycle-step, for more details.

     You should always keep in mind that the use of the cycle mode is
     efficient only if the current time of the time interval is also
     part of that resource file line that has to be evaluated in this
     manner.  Otherwise, it is difficult to find out unobjectionably
     lateron when displaying the data and times, which Sun or Moon
     oriented value resulted in what time.

     The following example shows how the topocentric elevation angle of
     the Sun for the location Mu"nster, Germany, is calculated during
     two days in April 2000, and that for the time interval 12:00
     o'clock until 12:05 o'clock local time in each case:

          $ gcal %20000420 -Hno -f/dev/null -xdt -g::: \
          >      --here='0*d1#999_%ot+00+000_:_%oa+5158+00738,120' \

'--cycle-step=ARGUMENT'
     Changes the timestep value that is used between the starting and
     ending clocktime of the time interval, in which the Sun and Moon
     oriented special texts are calculated, that are dynamical, i.e.
     depending on the respective clocktime.  *Note Fixed date option
     '--cycle-end=ARGUMENT': x-cycle-end, how to define such a time
     interval.  Without the '--cycle-end' option, a '--cycle-step'
     option is completely ignored.  It also does not enable Gcal's cycle
     mode.  The ARGUMENT of the '--cycle-step' option is by change
     syntactically according to the argument which may be given to the
     '--time-offset' option, and that relative time offset value
     references based on the actual local time and Universal time cannot
     be made, respectively.  Gcal always uses the amount of the given
     timestep value.  Thus, the template for the argument that may be
     given to the '--cycle-step' option is '[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]'.  *Note
     Calendar option '--time-offset=ARGUMENT': x-time-offset, for the
     detailed explanation of the preceding option argument.

     The timestep value between the starting and the ending time of the

     *Note Sun data::, and *note Moon data::, for further information.

'--precise'
     The astronomical data and times that are created by the Sun and
     Moon oriented special texts, and the geographical data that is
     created by the distance and course angle oriented special text,
     respectively, are displayed by using a higher precision, i.e.
     according to the mode or style of representation and the type of
     special text, decimal values are displayed with more decimal
     places, or output of the time seconds part or the arcseconds part.

     *Note Sun data::, and *note Moon data::, likewise *note
     Geographical distance and course angle::, for further information.

'--execute-command'
     Causes on the one hand, that shell command '%![ARGUMENT]' special
     texts are executed, and not displayed textually only.  *Note Shell
     command '%![ARGUMENT]' special text: Shell Command, for more
     details.  And causes on the other hand, that 'TVAR?[COMMAND]' and
     'TVAR:[COMMAND]' text variable definitions is assigned the output
     of an external command, and not the text which contains the call of
     the external command.  *Note Text variables::, for further
     information.

'-D ARGUMENT'
'--filter-day=ARGUMENT'
     Displays only those fixed dates, whose date is not excluded by the
     given ARGUMENT.  *Note Date part of a line::, and likewise *note
     Exclusions without any argument '%?' special texts: Exclusions
     without any argument..  The ARGUMENT consists of one or more
     characters as used in the exclusion without any argument '%?'
     special text; but without the leading '%' character in each case.

     For example, it is possible to induce Gcal to display only those
     fixed dates from the resource file 'demo.rc' for the whole year
     which are legals holidays, and moreover, Saturdays or Sundays:

          gcal -f demo.rc --year --filter-day=Rv

'-P ARGUMENT'
'--filter-period=ARGUMENT'
     Displays only those fixed dates, whose date is not excluded by the
     given ARGUMENT.  *Note Date part of a line::, and likewise *note
     Exclusions with date argument '%?[DATE]' special texts: Exclusions
     with date argument..  The ARGUMENT consists of one or more
     expressions as used in the exclusion with date argument '%?[DATE]'
     special text; but without the leading '%' character in each case.
     You can use more than one of these '%?[DATE]' expressions by
     connecting them with a ',' character.

     For example, it is possible to induce Gcal to display only those
     fixed dates from the resource file 'demo.rc' for the whole year
     which appear within the period of the 17th and the 20th of any
     month, and which appear on the 31st of any month.

          gcal -f demo.rc -y -P i00000017#00000020,i00000031#00000031

'-I PATTERN'
'--filter-text=PATTERN'
     Displays only those fixed dates, whose completely expanded text(5)
     (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-5::) is matched by the given
     PATTERN.  *Note Text part of a line::, and *note '%?'... special
     texts for text replacement: Replacements..  The PATTERN is a
     _regular expression_, as recognized by the Unix 'ed' line-editor.
     *Note Regular Expressions::, for further information.

     For example, it is possible to induce Gcal to display all fixed
     dates from the resource file 'doctor.rc' for the current month,
     which are defined for dentists or oculists:

          gcal -f doctor.rc --month -I "[dD]entist|[oO]culist"

     Each time a '_' (underscore) character is found in the PATTERN
     argument, this character is replaced by a real ' ' (space)
     character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\_'.  If you need the
     '\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash)
     character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\_'.

'--ignore-case'
     Ignores all case distinctions in both the completely expanded text
     and the PATTERN of the '--filter-text=PATTERN' option.  *Note Fixed
     date option '--filter-text=PATTERN': x-filter-text.

'--revert-match'
     Displays all those fixed dates, whose completely expanded text does
     not match the PATTERN of the '--filter-text=PATTERN' option.  *Note
     Fixed date option '--filter-text=PATTERN': x-filter-text.

'-c|C[-]'
'--today'
'--list-of-fixed-dates[=short|long]'
'--descending-fixed-dates[=short|long]'
     Activate the fixed date function and display fixed date messages,
     if any.

     '-c'
     '--today'
     '--list-of-fixed-dates=short'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in ascending order.  If no fixed dates
          related to the current day are found, no fixed date messages
          are displayed and the program is terminated with an error
          code.  *Note Error Code 1: x-1-Error-code.

     '-c-'
     '--descending-fixed-dates=short'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in descending order.  If no fixed dates
          related to the current day are found, no fixed date messages
          are displayed and the program is terminated with an error
          code.  *Note Error Code 1: x-1-Error-code.

     '-C'
     '--list-of-fixed-dates=long'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in ascending order.  If no fixed dates
          related to the current day are found, an "empty" fixed date
          message is displayed which is only consisting of the date.

     '-C-'
     '--descending-fixed-dates=long'
          Activate fixed date function (use standard resource file
          implicitly) and list all dates related to the actual system
          date (==today), sorted in descending order.  If no fixed dates
          related to the current day are found, an "empty" fixed date
          message is displayed which is only consisting of the date.

'-f|F NAME[+...]'
'--resource-file=NAME[+...]'
     Activate fixed date function and use file NAME instead of the
     standard resource file.  Then list all dates, sorted in ascending
     order which occur in the fixed date period.  If no other fixed date
     period is specified, the actual system date (==today) is used for
     the fixed date period.  If the option letter 'f' of the short-style
     option is used and no dates related to the fixed date period are
     found in NAME, no fixed date messages are displayed and the program
     is terminated with an error code.  *Note Error Code 1:
     x-1-Error-code.  If the option letter 'F' of the short-style option
     is used and no dates related to the fixed date period are found in
     NAME, an "empty" fixed date message is displayed which is only
     consisting of the date.

     You can use more than one resource file NAME by connecting them
     with a '+' character, e.g.:

          '--resource-file=./foo+xyz+/data/bar+$HOME/.gcalrc' resp.,
          '-f ./foo+xyz+/data/bar+$HOME/.gcalrc'

     respects all files given in the preceding argument by using a
     special file search mechanism.  *Note File searching mechanism:
     x-File-searching-mechanism, for more details.  Use '/dev/null' to
     avoid the use of the standard resource file, useful for creating
     _empty fixed date lists_.  If a single '-' character is given as
     file NAME, like '--resource-file=./foo+-+xyz' or '-F-', but not
     '-F -', Gcal reads and processes all input received from the
     _standard input channel_.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '+' separator
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\+'.  If you need the
     '\+' characters themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash)
     character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\+'.

     Each time a '_' (underscore) character is found in NAME, this
     character is replaced by a real ' ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\_'.  If you need the
     '\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash)
     character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\_'.

'-# LINE'
'--here=LINE'
     Activate fixed date function and use the LINE argument together
     with the standard resource file respectively additional resource
     files.  The LINE argument has to be a valid line as it may occur in
     a Gcal resource file (*note Structure of resource file::), and is
     always evaluated last *after* the processing of all resource files,
     so dealing with references to exported local date or text variables
     is enabled.  This option may be given multiple and it will be
     processed exactly in the given order.  All dates are listed, sorted
     in ascending order which occur in the fixed date period.  If no
     other fixed date period is specified, the actual system date
     (==today) is used for the fixed date period.  If no dates related
     to the fixed date period are found in the LINE, no fixed date
     messages are displayed and the program is terminated with an error
     code.  *Note Error Code 1: x-1-Error-code.

     For example, the call:

          gcal -# "0*d1su#99su.7 ^%Z" --here="#include <foo>" -y

     causes the implicit processing of the standard resource file just
     before the further resource file line '0*d1su#99su.7 ^%Z' and
     following '#include <foo>' are processed, and that as if these
     lines were a physical part of the standard resource file.

     Each time a '_' (underscore) character is found in LINE, this
     character is replaced by a real ' ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\_'.  If you need the
     '\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash)
     character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\_'.

*Please note:*
If the short-style option '-c' and/or its modifiers 't|[w|m|y[+|-]', or
the short-style option '-f' is/are given in *upper-case*, e.g.:

     -C
     -F foo.bar
     -CeT
     -c-aW+
     -CeaxY-
     -c-M

Gcal displays fixed date messages for *every* day of the requested
period.

  The modifiers of a combined/complex/packed short-style fixed date
option must be constructed according to following steps, because Gcal
treats them as positional parameters:

     First step: _Representation-of-text-modifier_
          'a', 'A', 'e|E', 'J', 'k', 'o', 'Q', 'U', 'x', 'z', 'Z'

     Second step: _Period-of-fixed-dates-modifier_
          'd', 'l', 't|T', 'w|W|m|M|y|Y[+|-]', 'N+|-', 'Nd', 'Nw',
          '*dN[WWW]', '*wN[WWW]', '@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N]',
          '@e|t|DVAR[+|-]NWWW', 'MMDD', 'MMWWWN'

  If you want to operate with the preceding modifiers, an *explicit*
'-c|C[-]' short-style option must be leading on the one hand, e.g.:

     -c-t
     -cw-
     -CZdekloQUzJaxA12+

and only *one* period defining fixed date period modifier may be
given(6) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-6::).

Or on the other hand, the modifiers must be given as single character
options or composed into a single command line word, and additionally
either the short-style option '-c|C[-]', '-f|F NAME[+...]' or
'-# LINE'(7) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-7::) must be given like:

     -c -t
     -w- -c
     -a -Ad -e -kloQUxz -C12+
     -F foo.bar -dJZA -l*d10
     --here="; Comment" -dZAa

If the modifiers are given as single character options or composed into
a single command line word, and one of the 't|T|[w|W|m|M|y|Y[+|-]]'
modifiers is used(8) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-8::), it is
unnecessary to give a '-c|C[-]' respectively '-f|F NAME[+...]'
short-style option(9) (*note Fixed date options-Footnote-9::) to
activate the fixed date function of Gcal, because it is triggered
implicitly by means of these modifiers / alias names.

  *Note Coding Scheme::, whose tables explain the relations between the
_date part_ (YYYY...) of a resource file line and the modifiers, the
short-style option '-c|C[]' --which is used for enabling the fixed date
feature-- respectively the long-style option
'--period-of-fixed-dates=ARGUMENT' may have, i.e. they point out all
possible correspondences.  This is necessary because Gcal does not
respect all entries found in a resource file if a _fixed date_ argument
is given, it respects only those entries which have a definite relation
to the _fixed date_ argument to avoid the output of redundant
information!

*Fixed date text modifiers and options:*

'--biorhythm-axis=NUMBER'
     The width of the biorhythm text graphics --which can be created by
     means of the biorhythm text graphics '%;[DATE]' special text-- is
     changed to NUMBER characters for each axis of the bar.  The NUMBER
     argument must be an integer value between 1...100, the default
     number of characters is 20.  If the NUMBER divides 100 with a
     remainder, it is internally reduced to the nearest number that
     divides 100 without any remainder.  This means, only the numbers 1,
     2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100 are factually respected, so a
     NUMBER argument of 19 is internally reduced to 10.

     For example:

          $ cat bio.rc
          -| 0*d1#999 %;19620921
          $ gcal -fbio.rc %19961212 -s0 -xw --biorhythm-axis=19

     *Note Biorhythm '%?[DATE]' special texts: Biorhythm, for more
     details.

'--moonimage-lines=NUMBER'
     The height of the Moon phase text graphics --which can be created
     by means of the Moon phase text graphics '%Z[DATE]' special text--
     is changed to NUMBER lines.  The NUMBER argument must be an integer
     value between 6...30, the default number of lines is 12.

     For example:

          $ gcal -f/dev/null -#0*d1#999_%Z__%O %19950407 -x --moon=8

     more details.

'a'
'--include-resource-file-name'
     Extend fixed date text by the name of the resource file and the
     line number which the fixed date text comes from, e.g.:

          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: (`Eternal holiday list'#00003) New Year's day
          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: (.gcalrc#00987) No fixed dates
          ...

'A'
'--alternative-format'
     Instead of using the "standard" list format, e.g.:

          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: New Year's day
          Mon, Jan   1st 1995: No fixed dates
          ...

     Gcal uses the "alternative" list format, e.g.:

          Mon, Jan   1st 1995:
          New Year's day
          No fixed dates
          ...

'e'
'--include-holidays=long'
     Enable inclusion of all built-in eternal holiday dates.  This
     includes legal holidays and memorial days.

'E'
'--include-holidays=short'
     Enable inclusion of those built-in eternal holiday dates which are
     legal holidays only.

'g[TEXT]'
'--grouping-text[=TEXT]'
     Group fixed dates by day by using the TEXT separator.  If TEXT is
     not given, the built-in TEXT(10) (*note Fixed date
     options-Footnote-10::) is used for grouping, e.g.:

          $ gcal -Cxw -cg
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994: Text 1

          -| -grouping text-
          -| Tue, Nov   8th 1994: Text 4
          ...

     The TEXT may contain references to global date and text variables
     (*note Fixed date option '--date-variable=ARGUMENT':
     x-date-variable, and *note Fixed date option
     '--date-variable=ARGUMENT': x-text-variable.).  Furthermore, all
     special texts which cause a text replacement may be used in the
     TEXT (*note '%?'... special texts for text replacement:
     Replacements.).

     Each time a '~' (tilde) or '^' (caret) character is found in TEXT,
     this character is replaced by a real '\n' (newline) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '~' (tilde) character
     --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a '\'
     (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\~'.  If you need the '\~'
     characters themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash)
     character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\_'.  All
     above mentioned facts are also valid for the '^' (caret) character.

     Each time a '_' (underscore) character is found in TEXT, this
     character is replaced by a real ' ' (space) character.

     You may depreciate the special meaning of the '_' (underscore)
     character --in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a
     '\' (backslash) character before it, e.g. '\_'.  If you need the
     '\_' characters themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash)
     character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\_'.

'k'
'--include-week-number'
     The leading date of a fixed date message is either extended by the
     ISO week number or the standard week number.  *Note Calendar option
     '--starting-day=ARGUMENT': x-starting-day, *note Calendar option
     '--iso-week-number=yes|no': x-iso-week-number, and *note Aspects in
     Internationalization: Internationalization, for further details.

'o'
'--omit-multiple-date-part'
     Omit displaying the leading date of a fixed date message in case
     more than one message refers to that date(11) (*note Fixed date
     options-Footnote-11::), e.g.:

          $ gcal -cxo
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994: Text 1
          -|                      Text 2
          ...

'Q'
'--suppress-fixed-dates-list-separator'
     Suppress displaying of the blank line which is always leading a
     fixed date list.  For example, to cause Gcal to print only the
     number of days between 1st January 1970 and 1st January 1980, you
     can call the program like this:

          $ gcal -f /dev/null -QUx %19800101 -#0_%j-2440588
          -| 3652

'U'
'--suppress-date-part'
     Suppress displaying the leading date of a fixed date message, e.g.:

          -|
          -| Text 1
          -| Text 2
          ...

'J'
'--suppress-text-part'
     Suppress displaying the text part of a fixed date message, e.g.:

          $ gcal -cxJ
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994:
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994:
          ...

'x'
'--exclude-fixed-dates-list-title'
     Suppress the title text line of the fixed date list.

'--heading-text=TEXT'
     Changes the title text line of the fixed date list.  Instead of
     displaying the default 'Fixed date list:' text, any other text can
     be used as heading text of the fixed date list, e.g.:

          $ gcal -cUJ --heading-text=Hello,_it_is_%K_,~%t__o'clock
          -|
          -| Hello, it is Sunday,
          -| 14:32 o'clock
          -|
          -| Sun, Nov   6th 1994:
          ...

     The TEXT may contain references to global date and text variables
     (*note Fixed date option '--date-variable=ARGUMENT':
     x-date-variable, and *note Fixed date option
     '--date-variable=ARGUMENT': x-text-variable.).  Furthermore, all

     '--leap-day=march'
          A fixed date that appears in every year and which is related
          to the leap day, is displayed on the 1st March in non-leap
          years.

'd'
'--include-today'
     If lists of periods are generated, include the actual date into the
     list.  *Note Fixed date option '--list-mode': x-list-mode, how to
     create a list of periods.

3.1.2 Response file
-------------------

If a '@FILE' command line argument is given, a "response file" by the
name of FILE will be used, i.e. options and commands are preloaded from
that file.  A response FILE may contain options and commands --which are
preloaded by Gcal--, but *no* references to further response files.  If
such references to further response files are found, they are ignored.
*Note Global option '--response-file=NAME': x-response-file, for hints
how to generate a response file automatically.

  The searching scheme for a response file is the same as that for
resource files, except *no* standard response file is respected.  *Note
File searching mechanism: x-File-searching-mechanism, for more details.
Multiple response files may be given in the command line when Gcal is
started, and they are processed exactly in that order as given, i.e.
strictly sequential.

  Each option and command must be on a single line, i.e. separated by a
real '\n' (newline) character.  A line beginning with a ';' (semicolon)
character in the response file is treated as a remark and will not be
used by Gcal (*note Comment line::).

  Options must be defined before commands.  If a response file contains
any commands, then all further arguments after the '@FILE' option of the
command line are ignored.

For example:

  1. Contents of response file 'file':

          Line     Text
          1        -j
          2        -Cw
          EOF

          $ gcal -i -b 3 @file -s 3 1994

          ==> gcal -i -b 3 -j -Cw -s 3 1994

  2. Contents of response file 'file':

          Line     Text
          1        -j
          2        -Cw
          3        may 1992
          EOF

          $ gcal -i -b 3 @file -s 3 1994

          ==> gcal -i -b 3 -j -Cw may

  3. Contents of response file 'file':

          Line     Text
          1        -j
          2        -Cw
          3        may
          4        1992

3.1.3 Actual date modifier
--------------------------

It is allowed to use that date --instead of the actual system date--
which is defined by the '%DATE' command line argument.  This means,
fixed dates can be checked for *any* year and are respected in the same
way, as if they would be fixed dates of the actual year.

  The date must be denoted in one of these formats:

   * 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN[WWW]'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]]'

   * 'MONTH NAME[DD]'

   * 'WEEKDAY NAME[N]'

   * DD

Some examples to this:

     *Please note:*
     The following examples assumes the actual system date is
     *Wednesday, the 17th February 1993* (19930217), weeks start on
     Mondays and ISO week numbers are used!

3.1.4 Commands
--------------

The commands control the periods Gcal respects.  They can be partitioned
into four major classes, namely "single" commands, special "3-Month
mode" commands, "lists" of commands and "ranges" of commands.  Single
commands and special 3-Month mode commands only create *one* calendar
sheet, ranges of commands or list of commands create *more than one*
calendar sheet per program run.  If a list of commands is given, Gcal
works sequentially on each single command given in the list, one by one.
A range of commands is expanded first by Gcal and after expansion is
done, Gcal works sequentially on each single command produced during the
internal expansion step.

  For understanding the notation used in the text below, MM is either a
number, a month name or one of the special 3-Month mode commands '.',
'..', '.+' and '.-'.  No lists or ranges of months or years can be
created in case a special 3-Month mode command is given.

  The range of MM is valid from 1 to 12 or valid from January to
December.  Both notations may be mixed.  Month names may be abbreviated
up to their first three characters.  YYYY is a number.  The range of
YYYY is valid from 1 to 9999.  A range ('MM-MM' or 'YYYY+YYYY' or ...)
must consist of two elements.  A list ('MM,...,MM' or 'YYYY;...;YYYY' or
...) must contain two elements minimum and may have any number of
elements.

Here is a list of all ranges of commands, lists of commands and other
command separator characters:

   * The '-' character is the _range of months_ separator.

   * The ',' character is the _list of months_ separator.

   * The '+' character is the _range of years_ separator.

   * The ';' character is the _list of years_ separator.

   * The '/' character is the _month of year_ separator.

   * The ':' character is the _fiscal year_ separator.

3.1.4.1 Single commands
.......................

'NOTHING'
     Current month of current year, called "single month mode" in the
     further context.

'MONTH NAME'
     Selected month of current year, e.g.:

          gcal may
          gcal OCTOBER
          gcal ja

'YYYY'
     Selected year, called "single year mode" in the further context,
     e.g.:

          gcal 1992

     But there is an exception of this general rule.  If the specified
     year number is less or equal twelve, Gcal assumes that a selected
     month of the current year is wanted.  If you want to have a
     selected year less or equal twelve, call Gcal like this

          gcal 1:6

     or like this

          gcal 6+6

     to obtain the year AD 6.

'MM YYYY'
'MM/YYYY'
     Single month of selected year, e.g.:

          gcal 9 1992
          gcal 9/1992
          gcal Nov 1777
          gcal Nov/1777

':'
     Single fiscal year, starting on the _actual month_ of the _actual
     year_ and ending on month _actual month_-1 of the _actual year_+1,
     called "implicit fiscal year" in the further context, e.g.:

          gcal :

'MM:'
     Single fiscal year, starting on month MM of the _actual year_ and
     ending on month MM-1 of the _actual year_+1, called "explicit
     fiscal year" in the further context, e.g.:

          gcal 6:
          gcal feb:
          gcal NOVEMBER:

':YYYY'
     Single fiscal year, starting on the _actual month_ of year YYYY and
     ending on month _actual month_-1 of year YYYY+1, also called
     "explicit fiscal year" in the further context, e.g.:

          gcal :1999

'MM:YYYY'
     Single fiscal year, starting on month MM of year YYYY and ending at
     month MM-1 of year YYYY+1, called "explicit fiscal year" too in the
     further context, e.g.:

          gcal 7:1999

     Range of specified fiscal years, e.g.:

          gcal 7:1999+8:1992
          gcal aug:1992+july:1999

3.2 The 'GCAL' environment variable
===================================

The environment variable 'GCAL' can hold a set of default options for
Gcal (*note Environment Variable 'GCAL': x-GCAL.).  These options are
interpreted first at program start-up, and some can be overwritten by
explicit command line arguments or values found in a '@FILE' response
file.  *Note Command line arguments::, and *note Response file::, for
further information.

For example:

   * for *sh*:
          GCAL="-i @color -b 3"; export GCAL

   * for *csh*:
          setenv GCAL "-i @color -b 3"

   * for *MS-DOS*:
          set GCAL=-i @color -b 3

  On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is 'GCAL_OPT', to
avoid a conflict with the symbol 'GCAL' set for invocation of the
program.

For example:

   * for *VMS*:
          define GCAL_OPT "-i @color -b 3"

4 Eternal Holidays
******************

The _eternal holiday list_ is created only for dates after AD 29.  It is
assumed that the Gregorian Reformation has occurred from 10th till 22nd
March 1924 for all Christian-Orthodox holidays, which are inserted into
the _eternal holiday list_.

  The _eternal holiday list_ can be displayed in different ways:

  If you start Gcal without an explicit (fiscal) date and the _eternal
holiday list_ argument (*note Calendar option
'--holiday-list[=long|short]': x-holiday-list.), e.g.:

     gcal -qfr --holiday-list
     gcal -qfr -n
     gcal -qfr -n :

Gcal displays all holidays of the eternal holiday list that refer to the
actual / fiscal year, without a leading calendar sheet.

  In case you start Gcal with the _eternal holiday list_ argument and a
month (plus an additional year), e.g.:

     gcal -qbe --holiday-list july
     gcal -qbe -n july
     gcal -qbe -n 7 1993
     gcal -qbe -n 7/1993

Gcal displays a month calendar sheet of the specified month (of year),
and trailing those holidays of the eternal holiday list that refer to
the given month (of the given year).

  If you start Gcal with the _eternal holiday list_ argument and a
simple year (or an explicit fiscal year), e.g.:

     gcal -qbe --holiday-list 1993
     gcal -qbe -n 1993
     gcal -qbe -n july:
     gcal -qbe -n :1993
     gcal -qbe -n 7:1993

Gcal displays a year calendar sheet of the specified year or fiscal
year, and trailing all holidays of the eternal holiday list that refer
to the given year or fiscal year.

  In case you start Gcal with the _eternal holiday list_ argument and a
special 3-Month mode command (*note 3-Month mode commands::), e.g.:

     gcal -qbe --holiday-list .
     gcal -qbe -n .
     gcal -qbe -n ..
     gcal -qbe -n .+
     gcal -qbe -n .-

Gcal displays the according three months by using a fixed-style year
calendar sheet, and trailing all holidays of the eternal holiday list
that refer to these months.

  In case you start Gcal with the _eternal holiday list_ argument and a
_list_ or _range_ of commands, it produces the according series of
eternal holiday lists.  *Note Lists of commands::, and *note Ranges of
commands::, for further details.

Some annotations:

  The following table lists all those characters which are used for
marking an entry in the eternal holiday list, i.e. directly lead its
date:

*Character*   *Description*
 
'+'           Legal holiday which is valid in the whole country.  Is
              automatically provided with highlighting sequences
              respectively marking characters.
'#'           Legal holiday which is valid in major parts of the whole
              country.  Is automatically provided with highlighting
              sequences respectively marking characters.
'*'           Legal holiday which is valid in minor parts of the whole
              country.  Is not provided with highlighting sequences
              respectively marking characters.
'-'           Other holiday which serves for memorial or remarking
              purposes only.  Is not provided with highlighting
              sequences respectively marking characters.

  By using the '--cc-holidays=CC[+...]' option, it is possible to
provide the eternal holiday list with additional country specific
holidays.  Thereafter, those country specific holidays are part of the
list.  *Note Calendar option '--cc-holidays=CC[+...]': x-cc-holidays.
For example:

     --cc-holidays=be+fr

causes the inclusion of Belgian and French holidays into the eternal
holiday list.  The inclusion of country specific holidays is not coupled
to Gcal's internationalization (*note Aspects in Internationalization:
Internationalization.).  This means, no country specific holidays are
automatically respected at program start-up for a definite territory or
country.  So it is up to the user to decide which country specific
holidays are included into the eternal holiday list.  *Note The 'GCAL'
environment variable: The GCAL environment variable, for information how
Gcal can be induced to include the country specific holidays
automatically into the eternal holiday list at program start-up.

  The free selection of the different country specific holidays can be
used very ingenious in case information of a definite territory or
country is required.  Assuming a business man from Germany proposes to
travel to Italy in November and needs the information which legal
holidays are celebrated there on working days so he is able to plan his
dates.  This can be determined as follows:

     gcal -f /dev/null -q IT -D r -cE nov

5 Fixed Dates
*************

This chapter describes how to use the _fixed date_ feature of Gcal.
Normally, the fixed dates are stored line by line in a so-called
resource file (*note Resource file::).  On request, Gcal searches any of
such resource files for those fixed dates, that are happening in the
period for which a fixed date list is wanted.  If Gcal has found any
fixed dates that are happening in the requested period, the program
displays them collectively as a fixed date list.

  Thus, each time you execute Gcal in simple single month mode, i.e. no
explicit month, year or fiscal year is given in the command line, but
the _fixed date_ argument, e.g.:

     gcal --list-of-fixed-dates
     gcal -c

it checks the resource file for dates and processes those that refer to
the actual system date (==today).  Then Gcal displays all fixed dates
found in the resource file which refer to the actual day
(week/month/year) of the actual year, without a leading calendar sheet.

Some more examples:

     gcal --ast -ce
     gcal -cw-
     gcal -c-m
     gcal -c-y-
     gcal -qbe -jcb -c-et
     gcal --zod -cey-
     gcal -qfr -jc -cey

  The fixed date list can be embraced by different other leading and
trailing output, respectively, that is also created by Gcal:

  In case you start Gcal with the _fixed date_ argument and/or a month
and/or an explicit year or fiscal year; respectively with the special
3-Month mode command, e.g.:

     gcal -c july
     gcal -qfr -ce 7 1994
     gcal -c-y 7/1994
     gcal -c 7:1993
     gcal -c 1993
     gcal -c .
     gcal -c .+

Gcal displays a (three) month / year calendar sheet of the specified
respectively actual month / year, and trailing those fixed dates found
in the resource file that refer to the given period; the intensity level
is the same as the '-cy' option if the period refers to a year or fiscal
year or to a three month period, respectively, is the same as the '-cm'
option if the period refers to a month.

  If you start Gcal without an explicit date and the _fixed date_
argument *in connection with* the _eternal holiday list_ argument, e.g.:

     gcal -qbe -n -c
     gcal -qbe -n -Cm
     gcal -qbe -n -Cl1224
     gcal -qbe -n -cl3+
     gcal -qbe -n -4-

then Gcal displays all fixed dates found in the resource file that refer
to the requested period, and after that all holidays of the eternal
holiday list that refer to the whole actual year, without a leading
calendar sheet.  *Note Eternal Holidays::, for more details how to use
an _eternal holiday list_.

Annotation to previous examples:

  Each time you execute Gcal in simple single year mode, i.e. no
explicit month, year or fiscal year is given in the command line, but
the _fixed date_ argument (with optional modifiers) and the _number of
blocks_ argument (*note Calendar option '--blocks=NUMBER': x-blocks.),
e.g.:

     gcal -c --blocks=3
     gcal -C-em -b 3 --cc-holidays=be
     gcal -c-t -b 6 -jc

it checks the resource file for dates and processes those that refer to
the actual system date (==today).  Gcal displays a leading year calendar
sheet, and all fixed dates found in the resource file that refer to the
actual day (week/month/year) of the actual year.

  You can list fixed dates of past, present or future month/years, too.
This can be done on the one hand, if you use the '%DATE' option in the
way you require (*note Actual date modifier::), and on the other hand,
if a command respectively a _list_ or _range_ of commands is used.

For example:

'gcal -qbe -c -n- 1993'
     Lists all fixed dates of entire 1993 in ascending order, and the
     eternal holiday list of entire 1993 in descending order; the
     intensity level is the same as the '-cy' option.

'gcal -c- july:1993'
     Lists all fixed dates of fiscal year --starting in July 1993 and
     ending in June 1994-- in descending order; the intensity level is
     the same as the '-cy' option.

'gcal -qbe -ce july 1993'
     Lists all fixed dates of July 1993 inclusive all eternal holidays
     merged into this list in ascending order; the intensity level is
     the same as the '-cm' option.

'gcal -qbe -c-e -n 1993+1996'
     Lists all fixed dates of entire 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 (series
     of years) inclusive all eternal holidays merged into this list in
     descending order, and the eternal holiday list related to all above
     years in ascending order; the intensity level is the same as the
     '-cy' option.

'gcal -cm %19920317'
     Lists all fixed dates of March 1992 in ascending order.

'gcal -qbe %1994@e -n -c'
     Lists all fixed dates of Easter Sunday 1994 in ascending order, and
     the eternal holiday list of entire 1994 in ascending order.

5.1 Resource file
=================

This section describes how to use a "resource file" that contains fixed
dates and appointments.  The name of the standard resource file is
'HOME/.gcalrc'(1) (*note Resource file-Footnote-1::).

Gcal uses a special file searching mechanism:

  1. The Gcal program scans the file directories which are referenced in
     the environment variable 'GCALPATH' (*note Environment Variable
     'GCALPATH': x-GCALPATH.) to find the standard resource file.  The
     'GCALPATH' environment variable contains a (':') colon-separated(2)
     (*note Resource file-Footnote-2::) list of file directories.  If no
     such environment variable is defined and set, Gcal omits this step.

  2. If the above action fails, Gcal looks for the standard resource
     file in the file directory which is referenced in the environment
     variable 'HOME'.  If no 'HOME' environment variable is defined and
     set, Gcal also omits this step.  *Note Environment Variable 'HOME':
     x-HOME.

  3. If the above action fails, Gcal inspects the _user data_ file
     directory(3) (*note Resource file-Footnote-3::) to find the
     standard resource file.  This file directory is a file directory
     relative to the 'HOME' file directory.  If an environment variable
     'GCAL_USR_DATADIR' is set, Gcal appends the contents of this
     environment variable to the contents of the 'HOME' environment
     variable, and tries to use this file directory instead of using the
     burned-in default name of this file directory (*note Environment
     Variable 'GCAL_USR_DATADIR': x-GCAL_USR_DATADIR.).  If no 'HOME'
     environment variable is defined and set, Gcal of course also omits
     this step.

  4. If all above actions fail, Gcal inspects the _system data_ file
     directory(4) (*note Resource file-Footnote-4::) to find the
     standard resource file.  This file directory is a file directory
     absolute to the _root_/$PREFIX file directory.  If an environment
     variable 'GCAL_SYS_DATADIR' is set, Gcal tries to use this file
     directory instead of using the burned-in default name of this file
     directory (*note Environment Variable 'GCAL_SYS_DATADIR':
     x-GCAL_SYS_DATADIR.).

  If the standard resource file is not found during the steps 1...4 of
the file searching mechanism, no fixed date messages will be created!

  In case the '--debug=abort' option is given and no standard resource
file is found during the steps 1...4 of the file searching mechanism,
the Gcal program will be aborted with an error code.  *Note Error Code
118: x-118-Error-code, and *note Global option '--debug=abort':
x-debug-abort, for more information.

  If a '-f|F NAME[+...]' respectively '--resource-file=NAME' command
line argument is given, a file NAME will be used for the resource file
instead of the standard resource file.  *Note Fixed date option
'--resource-file=NAME': x-resource-file.

Annotation:

  An "extended file name" contains one ore more '/' (slash)
characters(5) (*note Resource file-Footnote-5::) and denotes a file,
whose fixed access path either starts from the root file directory, like
'/foo/bar/file', or from the actual file directory, like './bar/file' or
'../bar/file'.  If NAME is an extended file name:

   * In case file NAME is found, Gcal will use it.

   * In case file NAME is not found, Gcal will not use it.

  A "simple file name" denotes a file, whose access-path either does not
start from the root file directory or from the actual file directory,
like 'file' or 'bar/file'.  If NAME is a simple file name:

   * Gcal tries to find this file NAME by using the previously explained
     file searching mechanism.

   (1) On MS-DOS, OS/2 and some other operating systems, the name of the
_standard resource file_ is 'HOME/gcalrc' (without a leading '.').

   (2) On MS-DOS, OS/2 and some other operating systems, another
character will be used, e.g. ';' on MS-DOS and OS/2.

   (3) Normally 'HOME/share/gcal'.

   (4) Normally '/usr/local/share/gcal' or '$PREFIX/share/gcal'.

   (5) Operating systems like MS-DOS or OS/2 use the '\' (Backslash)
character for separating a file directory from a file name.

5.1.1 Structure of resource file
--------------------------------

First of all, a Gcal resource file is a plain ASCII text file.  This
text file may be created by any text editor or by redirecting the
_standard output channel_ to a file, e.g.:

     $ echo '19930217 Text'>> resource-file <RET>

  A special --but simple-- line structure is required so Gcal is able to
interpret its contents.  Each fixed date entry in a resource file must
be split into two parts, namely a _date part_ and an optional _text
part_ which *must* be separated by *one* "whitespace"(1) (*note
Structure of resource file-Footnote-1::) character minimum.  It is
unnecessary to give a whitespace separator character if no _text part_
is specified.

  A line must always end with a '\n' (newline) character, except it is
the last line of a resource file.  The maximum length of a line is
limited to 'INT_MAX'(2) (*note Structure of resource file-Footnote-2::)
characters.  A newline character is automatically appended to the line
if the _standard output channel_ is directed to a file.  A newline
character is appended to the typed line in a text editor window if it is
completed by pressing the <RET> key.  In case the used text editor does
not generate the newline character in this way, it should be set to this
mode of operation, otherwise this text editor is useless for creating
Gcal resource files.

The line structure of fixed date entries is:

     DATE PART [ _whitespace_ TEXT PART ] _newline_

or more concrete, e.g.:

     YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]] [ _whitespace_ TEXT ] _newline_

or much more concrete, e.g.:

     19940217 Hi, I'm the text!

Besides fixed date entries, a resource file may contain further entries
like:

Comments...

     ; A remarked line
     ;     A formatted and multi-line \
           remark

Include directives...

     #include <FILE NAME>
     #include "FILE NAME"

Date variable assignments respectively operations...

     DVAR=NOTHING
     DVAR=MMDD
     DVAR=MMWWWN
     DVAR=*dN[WWW]
     DVAR=*wN[WWW]
     DVAR=DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]]
     DVAR++
     DVAR--
     DVAR+=[+|-]N
     DVAR-=[+|-]N
     DVAR+=NWWW
     DVAR-=NWWW

Text variable assignments respectively operations...

     TVAR=[TEXT]
     TVAR?[COMMAND]
     TVAR:[COMMAND]
     TVAR++
     TVAR--
     TVAR+=[+|-]N
     TVAR-=[+|-]N

Text variable references...

     TVAR

  Text variable references at the beginning of a Gcal resource file line
may only be used if it is ensured that they are expanded to a valid Gcal
resource file line.

   (1) For example _Tab_, _Space_, _Form-feed_ and similar characters.

   (2) Normally, this is for example equivalent to a value of 32,767 ==
(2^15)-1 on a 16-Bit machine architecture; to a value of 2,147,483,648
== (2^31)-1 on a 32-Bit machine architecture etc.

5.1.2 Date part of a line
-------------------------

The structure of a "date part" --which gives Gcal the information at
which date a fixed date happens-- of a line in the resource file is

*either*: 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]'

     'YYYY'
          (4 digits), is the year including the century (range
          '0000...9999').  Leading zeroes are required in case the
          defined year is less than '1000' and other components of the
          date part are trailing the year.

     'MM'
          (2 digits or 3 characters), is the month (range '00...12' or
          '99', respectively 'Jan', 'Feb'...).  A given '99' for the
          month means the last month of the year (== December).  Leading
          zeroes are required in case the defined month is less than
          '10' and other components of the date part are trailing the
          month.

     'DD'
          (2 digits), is the day (range '00...31' or '99').  A given
          '99' for the day means the last day of the month.  Leading
          zeroes are required in case the defined day is less than '10'
          and other components of the date part are trailing the day.

     'WWW'
          (2...3 characters), is a short weekday name (range
          'Mon...Sun').

     'N'
          (1 digit), is the N'th weekday WWW of month (range '1...5' or
          '9').

             * N == '1...5'
               N'th weekday WWW of month.

             * N == '9'
               Last weekday WWW of month.

*or*: 'YYYY*d|wN[WWW]'

     'YYYY'
          (4 digits), is the year including the century (range
          '0000...9999').  Leading zeroes are required in case the
          defined year is less than '1000' and other components of the
          date part are trailing the year.

     '*d'
          (2 characters), is the reference to an ordinary date.

     '*w'
          (2 characters), is either the reference to a date of an ISO
          week or the reference to a date of a standard week.

     'N'
          (1...3 digits), is the value in days or in weeks, the fixed
          date occurs.  A given '99' connected with a short weekday name
          means the last weekday WWW of the year.  A given '999'
          connected with '*d' means the last day of a year, i.e. the
          31st December.  If the computed date does not occur in the
          year, i.e. exceeds the year bounds, the fixed date message is
          suppressed.

     'WWW'
          (2...3 characters), is a short weekday name (range
          'Mon...Sun').

*or*: 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N]'

     'YYYY'
          (4 digits), is the year including the century (range
          '0000...9999').  Leading zeroes are required in case the
          defined year is less than '1000' and other components of the
          date part are trailing the year.

     '@e'
          (2 characters), is the reference to the Easter Sunday's date.

     '@t'
          (2 characters), is the reference to today's date.

     '@DVAR'
          (2 characters), is the reference to a date variable.

     '[+|-]N'
          (1...4 alphanumeric characters), is the optional displacement
          value in days, the fixed date occurs relative to the Easter
          Sunday's date, relative to today's date, or relative to a date
          variables date.  A given '-999' means the first day of a year,
          i.e. the 1st January.  A given '+999' or '999' means the last
          day of a year, i.e. the 31st December.  If the computed date
          does not occur in the year, i.e. exceeds the year bounds, the
          fixed date message is suppressed.

*or*: 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[+|-]NWWW'

     'YYYY'
          (4 digits), is the year including the century (range
          '0000...9999').  Leading zeroes are required in case the
          defined year is less than '1000' and other components of the
          date part are trailing the year.

     '@e'
          (2 characters), is the reference to the Easter Sunday's date.

     '@t'
          (2 characters), is the reference to today's date.

     '@DVAR'
          (2 characters), is the reference to a date variable.

     '[+|-]NWWW'
          (3...7 alphanumeric characters), is the optional displacement
          value in weekdays, the fixed date occurs relative to the
          Easter Sunday's date, relative to today's date, or relative to
          a date variables date.  A given '-99' means the first weekday
          WWW of the year.  A given '+99' or '99' means the last weekday
          WWW of the year.  If the computed date does not occur in the
          year, i.e. exceeds the year bounds, the fixed date message is
          suppressed.

*Please note:*

   * If YYYY is specified as '0000', '000', '00' or '0':
     The month and day are assumed to be annual events and the _text
     part_ will be displayed for any year.

   * If MM is not defined or specified as '00' or '0':
     The day is assumed to be a monthly event for the specified year and
     the _text part_ will be displayed for any month.

   * If DD is not defined or specified as '00' or '0':
     Each day is assumed to be a daily event for the specified year and
     month and the _text part_ will be displayed for any day.

   * If WWW is specified as a short (2...3 characters) weekday name:
     The given weekday name is assumed to be a weekly event for the
     specified year and month and the _text part_ will be displayed for
     any week.

*Hint:*
Preceding table ease misleading assumption that a fixed date, which
shall be valid for any days of the year, can be defined with a date part
only consisting of a '0'.  But that is only correct in that the
so-defined fixed date is respected in some few fixed date periods only
(*note Coding Scheme::).

  If a fixed date is defined which shall be respected for any days of
the year, it must be designed with a '0*d1#999' date part.  For example,
the same is likewise valid for fixed dates which represent a weekly
event, and that shall be valid during all the year.  Instead of creating
such a fixed date with a '000000WWW' date part (that is likewise
respected in some few fixed date periods only), it should be defined
with a date part like '0*d1WWW#99WWW.7'.  *Note Ranges of days::, and
*note Appearance factor of days::, for further information.

5.1.3 Further date part attributes
----------------------------------

The date part --which is leading a fixed date text of a Gcal resource
file line-- may be provided with further attributes, that are either
specifications of lists of days or ranges of days, which provide the
information at which date a fixed date happens.  More further attributes
are the repetition factor as well as the appearance factor.

  All of those date parts in a Gcal resource file line, which are
structured as follows, may generally be provided with further
attributes:

   * 'YYYYMM...'

   * 'YYYY*d|w...'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR...'

*Attention:*
If the date part is supplied with further attributes and the year of the
fixed date is not given in a concrete manner, i.e. the year YYYY is set
to zero, such kinds of fixed dates are *only* computed correctly in
simple year bounds --which means during a current year-- and not in
fixed dates shown after the current year has changed, e.g. in *fiscal
years*.

5.1.3.1 Lists of days
.....................

A list of days is used to define recurrent fixed dates and to use only
one line in the resource file for them, instead of using several lines
in a resource file needed for defining these recurrent fixed dates
separately.

  A list of days is specified by a ',' separator character; it must
contain two elements minimum and may have any number of elements.  A
single element of the list may not be set to a zero value and be not
concrete therefore.  (This would not make any sense in this context.)

  Assuming a fixed date shall always occur on the 1st and the 15th day
in every month of the year 1996, e.g. 'Tax returns', one solution would
be on the one hand a fixed date entry in the resource file for the 1st
of the month and another entry for the 15th of the month, which would be
a total of two entries in the resource file for such a fixed date.

  On the other hand, this expense can be reduced to a total of only one
entry in the resource file by using a list of days, which is likewise
valid for the 1st and the 15th day in every month, that is

     19960001,15 Tax returns

The use of lists of days in the date part is permitted as follows:

   * 'YYYYMMDD|WWW|WWWN,[MM]DD|[MM]WWW|[MM]WWWN ...'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN|NWWW,N|NWWW ...'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR,|[+|-]N[WWW],[+|-]N[WWW] ...'

Some examples to this:

'000001fr3,12,99,mon,apr14,993,julfri3,08fr'
     In every year in January: on the 3rd Friday, on the 12th, on the
     last day of the month and on every Monday.  And in every year: on
     the 14th April, on the 3rd December, on the 3rd Friday in July and
     on every Friday in August.

'199600mon,fr,12'
     In the year 1996 in every month: on every Monday, on every Friday
     and on the 12th.

'0*d1,1fr,999,17mo'
     In every year: on the first day of the year, on the 1st Friday of
     the year, on the last day of the year and on the 17th Monday of the
     year.

'1996*w1fr,1,17mo,99fr'
     In the year 1996: on Friday of the 1st week, on Monday of the first
     week, on Monday of the 17th week and on Friday of the last week.

'0@a,+1,-3,5,+4fr,2fr,-10sa'
     In every year: on the date of the date variable A, one day after
     the date of A, three days before the date of A, five days after the
     date of A, four Fridays after the date of A, two Fridays after the
     date of A and ten Saturdays before the date of A.

'1996@e+1,-3,5,+4fr,2fr,-10sa'
     In the year 1996: one day after the Easter Sunday's date, three
     days before the Easter Sunday's date, five days after the Easter
     Sunday's date, four Fridays after the Easter Sunday's date, two
     Fridays after the Easter Sunday's date and ten Saturdays before the
     Easter Sunday's date.

'1996@t+1,-3,5,+4fr,2fr,-10sa'
     In the year 1996: one day after today's date, three days before
     today's date, five days after today's date, four Fridays after the
     today's date, two Fridays after today's date and ten Saturdays
     before today's date.

5.1.3.2 Ranges of days
......................

A range of days just as a list of days is used to define recurrent fixed
dates and to use only one line in the resource file for them, instead of
using several lines in a resource file needed for defining these
recurrent fixed dates separately.

  A range of days is specified by a '#' separator character and must
consist of two elements, namely the starting day and the final day.  The
starting day and likewise the final day of the range may not be set to a
zero value and be not concrete therefore.  (This would not make any
sense in this context.)

  Assuming a fixed date shall always occur during the 1st and the 15th
day (inclusive) in every month of the year 1996, e.g. 'Inside work', one
solution would be on the one hand a fixed date entry in the resource
file for the 1st of the month, another one for the 2nd of the month
until the 15th of the month, which would be a total of 15 entries in the
resource file for such a fixed date(1) (*note Ranges of
days-Footnote-1::).

  On the other hand, this expense can be reduced to a total of only one
entry in the resource file by using a range of days, which is likewise
valid for the 1st until the 15th day in every month, that is

     19960001#15 Inside work

The use of ranges of days in the date part is permitted as follows:

   * 'YYYYMMWWW#WWW'

   * 'YYYYMMDD|WWWN#[MM]DD|[MM]WWWN'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN[WWW]#N[WWW]'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]]#[+|-]N[WWW]'

  Preceding table shows that the starting and ending day can only be
specified by using date formats of the same type left and right the '#'
separator character.  Thus, it is not explicitly possible to define a
range of days by using different types of date formats, means, fixed
date entries like:

     1996@e+3fr#1012 In the year 1996: every day that appears within the\
                     period of the date 3 Fridays after Easter Sunday's\
                     date until the 12th October.

cannot be defined like this.  But this problem can be solved by using an
inclusive date period '%i[DATE][#[DATE]]' special text for defining the
ending day of the range(2) (*note Ranges of days-Footnote-2::), and the
fixed dates are simply produced until the last day of the year, e.g.:

     1996@e+3fr#+999 In the year 1996: every day that appears within the\
                     period of the date 3 Fridays after Easter Sunday's\
                     date until the 12th October.%i0#19961012

  *Note Inclusive date period '%i[DATE][#[DATE]]' special text:
Inclusive date period, for more details.

Some examples to this:

'199600mon#fr'
     In the year 1996 in every month: every day that appears within the
     day sequence 'mon, tue, wed, thu, fri'.

'000000fr#mon'
     In every year in every month: every day that appears within the day
     sequence 'fri, sat, sun, mon'.

'000001fr3#12'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 3rd Friday of the month until the 12th of the month.

'00000112#fr3'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 12th of the month until the 3rd Friday of the month.

'00000112#augfri3'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the 12th
     January until the 3rd Friday of August.

'0000sep13#99fr9'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the 13th
     September until the last Friday of December.

'0*d1#1fr'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the 1st
     day of the year until the 1rd Friday of the year.

'0*d99fr#333'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the last
     Friday of the year until the 333rd day of the year.

'1996*w1fr#17mo'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     Friday of the 1st week until the Monday of the 17th week.

'0@a#+4fr'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the date
     of the date variable A until the 4th Friday after the date of the
     date variable A.

'1996@e-3#+9fr'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     date three days before the Easter Sunday's date until the 9th
     Friday after the date of the Easter Sunday's date.

'1996@t-3#+99fr'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     date three days before today's date until the last Friday of the
     year.

   (1) Apart from the possibility, that a list of days can be used in
such a case.

   (2) Implicit solution.

5.1.3.3 Repetition factor of days
.................................

A repetition factor of days is used to define recurrent fixed dates and
to use only one line in the resource file for them, instead of using
several lines in a resource file needed for defining these recurrent
fixed dates separately.

  A repetition factor of days (':N') is specified by a ':' character and
must trail the day field --which must have a concrete value in a date
part of a Gcal resource file and has not been set to a zero value--
respectively either lead or trail an appearance factor of days.  Except
ranges of days or fixed dates which occur only on a definite weekday
like '199600mon Every Monday 1996', such a repetition factor may be
specified in all possible codings of date parts of a Gcal resource file.

  This factor may have values in range '1...999'.  Values greater than
the real difference between the date of the first occurrence of the
fixed date and the last day of the year are always reduced to this real
difference.  In this sense, any value greater '365'(1) (*note Repetition
factor of days-Footnote-1::) means a repetition factor until the last
day of the year.

  Assuming a fixed date shall always occur on the 15th day in every
month of the year 1996 and covers a period of four days (inclusive the
15th itself), e.g. 'Co-workers training', one solution would be on the
one hand a fixed date entry in the resource file for the 15th of the
month and the succeeding three days, which would be a total of four
entries in the resource file for such a fixed date(2) (*note Repetition
factor of days-Footnote-2::).

  On the other hand, this expense can be reduced to a total of only one
entry in the resource file by using a repetition factor of days, which
is likewise valid for the 15th and the three days which succeed the 15th
in every month, namely

     19960015:4 Co-workers training

The use of repetition factors of days in the date part is permitted as
follows:

   * 'YYYYMMDD:N|WWWN:N'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN:N|NWWW:N'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]]:N'

   * 'YYYYMMDD:N|WWWN:N,[MM]DD:N|[MM]WWWN:N ...'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN:N|NWWW:N,N:N|NWWW:N ...'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR:N,|[+|-]N[WWW]:N,[+|-]N[WWW]:N ...'

Some examples to this:

'000001fr3:11'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 3rd Friday of the month and the succeeding ten days.

'00000112:3'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 12th of the month and the succeeding two days.

'00000112:3,fr3:5'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 12th of the month and the succeeding two days, and that
     appears within the period of the 3rd Friday of the month and the
     succeeding four days.

'0*d1:1'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the 1st
     day of the year and no succeeding day.

'0*d1:2'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the 1st
     day of the year and the succeeding day.

'0*d99fr:333'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the last
     Friday of the year and the succeeding 332 days.  Well, in cases a
     fixed date exceeds the year bounds, it will only be produced until
     the last day of the year.

'1996*w1fr:17'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     Friday of the 1st week and the succeeding 16 days.

'0@a:4'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the date
     of the date variable A and the succeeding three days.

'1996@e-3:9'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     date three days before the Easter Sunday's date and the succeeding
     eight days.

'1996@t-3:9'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     date three days before today's date and the succeeding eight days.

   (1) Or '366' in leap years.

   (2) Apart from the possibility, that a list or a range of days can be
used in such a case.

5.1.3.4 Appearance factor of days
.................................

An appearance factor of days is used to define a concrete displacement
of recurrent fixed dates.

  An appearance factor of days ('.N') is specified by a '.' character
and must trail the day field --which must have a concrete value in a
date part of a Gcal resource file and has not been set to a zero value--
respectively either lead or trail a repetition factor of days.  Except
fixed dates which occur only on a definite weekday and are not specified
by using a range of days, like '199600mon Every Monday 1996', such an
appearance factor may be specified in all possible codings of date parts
of a Gcal resource file.  This factor may be specified with each single
element of lists of days, but in a range of days, this factor may trail
*only* the final day of the range.  Well, the use of such an appearance
factor is only helpful if it is either given in a range of days, or if
it is given together with a repetition factor.

  This factor may have values in range '1...999'.  Fixed dates will be
ignored if the factor takes values greater than the real difference
between the date of the occurrence of the fixed date and the last day of
the year, respectively the end of the period, for which the fixed dates
shall either be produced or respected.

  Assuming a fixed date shall always occur on the 15th day in every
month of the year 1996 and covers a period of seven days (inclusive the
15th itself), but shall only be respected every third day (i.e. two days
have to be skipped at a time) within this period, e.g.
'Training-college', one solution would be on the one hand a fixed date
entry in the resource file for the 15th of the month, for the 18th and
for the 21st of the month, which would be a total of three entries in
the resource file for such a fixed date(1) (*note Appearance factor of
days-Footnote-1::).

  On the other hand, this expense can be reduced to a total of only one
entry in the resource file by using an appearance factor of days, which
is likewise valid for the 15th, the 18th and the 21st in every month,
namely on the one hand by the use of a repetition factor

     19960015:7.3 Training-college

or on the other hand by the use of a range of days

     19960015#21.3 Training-college

The use of appearance factors of days in the date part is permitted as
follows:

   * 'YYYYMMDD:N.N|DD.N:N'

   * 'YYYYMMWWWN:N.N|WWWN.N:N'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN:N.N|N.N:N'

   * 'YYYY*d|wNWWW:N.N|NWWW.N:N'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]]:N.N'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]].N:N'

   * 'YYYYMMDD:N.N|WWWN:N.N,[MM]DD:N.N|[MM]WWWN:N.N ...'

   * 'YYYYMMDD.N:N|WWWN.N:N,[MM]DD:N.N|[MM]WWWN.N:N ...'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN:N.N|NWWW:N.N,N:N.N|NWWW:N.N ...'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN.N:N|NWWW.N:N,N.N:N|NWWW.N:N ...'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR:N.N,|[+|-]N[WWW]:N.N,[+|-]N[WWW]:N.N ...'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR.N:N,|[+|.]N[WWW].N:N,[+|.]N[WWW].N:N ...'

   * 'YYYYMMWWW#WWW.N'

   * 'YYYYMMDD|WWWN#[MM]DD|[MM]WWWN.N'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN[WWW]#N[WWW].N'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]]#[+|-]N[WWW].N'

Some examples to this:

'000001fr3:11.3'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 3rd Friday of the month and the succeeding ten days, but
     only every 3rd day within this period (skip two days at a time).

'00000112:3.2'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 12th of the month and the succeeding two days, but only
     every 2nd day within this period (skip one day at a time).

'00000112:3.2,fr3:5.3'
     In every year in January: every day that appears within the period
     of the 12th of the month and the succeeding two days, but only
     every 2nd day within this period (skip one day at a time), and that
     appears within the period of the 3rd Friday of the month and the
     succeeding four days, but only every 3rd day within this period
     (skip two days at a time).

'0*d1:10.1'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the 1st
     day of the year and the succeeding nine days, and this for any day
     within this period (skip zero days at a time).

'0*d1:2.5'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the 1st
     day of the year and the succeeding day, but only every 5th day
     within this period (skip four days at a time).  Well, the
     succeeding days (only one in this example) of the starting day (1st
     day of year) are not respected, because the next day resulted by
     the appearance factor exceeds the final day (resulted by the
     repetition factor) of the period.

'0*d99fr:333.61'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the last
     Friday of the year and the succeeding 332 days, but only every 61st
     day within this period (skip 60 days at a time).  Well, in cases a
     fixed date exceeds the year bounds, it will only be produced until
     the last day of the year.  No succeeding day (332 in this example)
     of the starting day (last Friday of the year) is respected by
     reason of the displacement value of 60 days, because the next day
     resulted by the appearance factor exceeds the final day (resulted
     by the repetition factor) of the period (the last day of the year).

'1996*w1fr:17.8'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     Friday of the 1st week and the succeeding 16 days, but only every
     8th day within this period (skip seven days at a time).

'0@a:4.3'
     In every year: every day that appears within the period of the date
     of the date variable A and the succeeding three days, but only
     every 3rd day within this period (skip two days at a time).

'1996@e-3:9.4'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     date three days before the Easter Sunday's date and the succeeding
     eight days, but only every 4th day within this period (skip three
     days at a time).

'1996@e3#-20sun.15'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     date three days after the Easter Sunday's date until the 20th
     Sunday before the Easter Sunday's date, but only every 15th day
     within this period (skip 14 days at a time).

'1996@t3#-20sun.15'
     In the year 1996: every day that appears within the period of the
     date three days after today's date until the 20th Sunday before
     today's date, but only every 15th day within this period (skip 14
     days at a time).

   (1) Apart from the possibility, that a list of days can be used in
such a case.

5.1.4 Text part of a line
-------------------------

The "text part" of a line in a resource file can be any text you like.
Indeed, some characters have a special meaning ('%', '$', '~', '^' and
'\') and must be protected should the occasion arise that special
character combinations are formed with them(1) (*note Text part of a
line-Footnote-1::) which might be used only textually.  If the text part
contains characters that are used for highlighting the text or format it
for a printer, or characters with decimal values above 127 in the code
table of the used character set(2) (*note Text part of a
line-Footnote-2::) not produced by Gcal itself, such characters
respectively sequences are displayed by Gcal in an *uninterpreted*
manner!  For that very reason, it can happen that the output of such
characters can potentially create problems with the used screen device
driver software and/or the external pager program, likewise mailing of
such texts by means of electronic mail.

  So-called 'NUL' characters(3) (*note Text part of a line-Footnote-3::)
may also occur in the text part, but they only cause the suppression of
all succeeding characters in the line.  In my opinion, it makes no
perceptible sense to output these 'NUL' characters uninterpreted, so
they are used for remarking purposes only; besides, the 'NUL' characters
would lead to the same problems as already mentioned above.

  A line of the resource file is continued on the next line if a '\-\n'
(backslash-newline) character sequence is found, e.g.:

The line:
     000000Mo Every Monday

and the lines:
     000000Mo \
     Every \
     Monday

produce the same output and are essentially equivalent.

  Furthermore, you can break-up the text of a "long text part" at any
place you like.  The term _long_ means in this context, that the text
displayed by Gcal would override the right text margin of the screen
respectively break-up at that margin.

  Each time a '~' (tilde) character is found in the text part, this
character is replaced by a real '\n' (newline) character.  Such texts
will be displayed by Gcal in a formatted manner at a left margin, this
means, they are lead by a definite number of space characters.

  You may depreciate the special meaning of the '~' (tilde) character
--in case this character itself is needed-- by placing a '\' (backslash)
character before it, e.g. '\~'.  If you need the '\~' characters
themselves, you have to protect the '\' (backslash) character by another
'\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\~'.

  Each time a '^' (caret) character is found in the text part, this
character is also replaced by a real '\n' (newline) character.  Such
texts will be displayed by Gcal at column 1, this means, they are not
lead by space characters.  The rules for protecting the '^' character
are the same as the rules used for protecting the '~' character.

The resource file 'lbrk-1.rc'

     $ cat lbrk-1.rc
     -| ; Hi, I'm `lbrk-1.rc' and alive now
     -| ;
     -| 0 I know I'm a short text
     -| 0 I hope I'm long enough~here, a line break-up~\
     -| and again~and now for the last time...
     -| 0 I hope I'm also long enough^here, a line break-up\
     -| ~and again^and now for the last time...
     -| 0 Am I another short text? Dunno...

is displayed as follows:

     $ gcal %00000101 --resource-file=./lbrk-1.rc --disable-highlighting
     -|
     -| Fixed date list:
     -|
     -| Sat, Jan   1st 2000: Am I another short text? Dunno...
     -| Sat, Jan   1st 2000: I hope I'm also long enough
     -| here, a line break-up
     -|                      and again
     -| and now for the last time...
     -| Sat, Jan   1st 2000: I hope I'm long enough
     -|                      here, a line break-up
     -|                      and again
     -|                      and now for the last time...
     -| Sat, Jan   1st 2000: I know I'm a short text

  Because _whitespace_ characters are used to separate the date part
from the text part(4) (*note Text part of a line-Footnote-4::), it is
not possible to supply the text part with leading _whitespace_
characters without further ado.  If one or more _whitespace_ characters
shall lead the text part, this can be arranged by protecting the *first*
of these _whitespace_ characters (and that by placing a '\' (backslash)
character before it), e.g. '\ ' if it is a space character.  By means of
such a character sequence, Gcal notices that the text trailing the '\'
character is no longer used for separating purposes, but is member of
the text part.  Gcal skips this specific, marking backslash character
(avoids its output) and processes the rest of the line as usual.

  The following example should be enough to elucidate the above facts.
The resource file 'wspc-1.rc'

     $ cat wspc-1.rc

     -| 0    What happens now?\\
     -| ~0  \  That!

   (1) Like '%i', '$a'...

   (2) These are potentially non-printable.

   (3) That is the character with the value zero in the code table of
the used character set.

   (4) These are internally skipped and remain undisplayed therefore.

5.1.5 '%?'... Special Texts
---------------------------

The text part of a resource file line may be provided with different
special texts which may occur in any(1) (*note Special Texts
processed-Footnote-1::) number and order.  All these texts start with a
'%' (percent) character which may be protected by a leading '\'
(backslash) character if the '%' (percent) character itself is wanted to
be used in the text part, e.g. '\%'.  The '%' character is mostly
trailed by an optional format instruction, (see *note Format
Instruction::, for the detailed description of the format instruction
and its components), and then trailed by a distinguishing mark --which
defines the kind of the special text to be used-- and if it is a letter,
Gcal accepts it *case-sensitive*.

  The purpose of these special texts is mainly to suppress output of
fixed dates in definite cases, either, or to provide them with
particular texts respectively to start external commands.  *Note
Description of all '%?'... Special Texts: Special Texts, for a complete
description of all usable special texts, and *note Summary of all
'%?'... Special Texts: Special Texts Summary, for an according
short-list of them.

For example, the resource file 'speci-1.rc'

     $ cat speci-1.rc
     -| ; I'm veracious very special :)
     -| ;
     -| 0 1. Today is %>1u*K , %>02&*D  %U  %Y !
     -| 0 2. It's the %>03&*N  day of the year.
     -| 0 3. The actual week number is: %k .
     -| 0 4. Currently, it's %t*  o'clock, Mr. %-USER .
     -| 0 5. Hurry up with your work~\
     -|    by reason sunrise is at %o+5158+00738+61,2: .

is displayed as follows (in case today's date is the 4th October 1996):

     $ gcal --resource-file=speci-1.rc -H no -ox
     -|
     -| Mon, Oct   4th 1999: 1. Today is MONDAY, 04th October 1999!
     -|                      2. It's the 277th day of the year.
     -|                      3. The actual week number is: 40.
     -|                      4. Currently, it's 06:53pm o'clock, Mr. esken.
     -|                      5. Hurry up with your work
     -|                         by reason sunrise is at 07:33.

   (1) Rational!

5.1.6 Comment line
------------------

A line(1) (*note Comment line-Footnote-1::) beginning with a ';'
(semicolon) character in the resource file is treated as a remark and
will not be used by Gcal!  Any _whitespace_ characters may lead the
remark character.  *Note Text part of a line::, for information how a
'NUL' character can be used for remarking purposes in a text part.

  The following example of the 'remark.rc' resource file --which *only*
consists of remarks-- should be enough to elucidate the above facts:

     $ cat remark.rc
     -| ;00001031 ^\
     -|                         .......^\

   (1) Physically and logically.

5.1.7 Include directives
------------------------

You may add '#include' directives in a resource file for searching and
loading further resource files(1) (*note Include
directives-Footnote-1::).  An '#include' directive tells Gcal to suspend
reading the current resource file and read one other resource file
before continuing.  The directive is a line in the resource file that
looks like this template:

     #include _whitespace_ ARGUMENT [_whitespace_] _newline_

The ARGUMENT can either be

     "FILE NAME"

or(2) (*note Include directives-Footnote-2::)

     <FILE NAME>

  One _whitespace_ character minimum is required between '#include' and
the ARGUMENT.  The ARGUMENT may be trailed by extra _whitespace_
characters and the line must always end with a '\n' (newline) character,
except it is the last line of a resource file.

Let us inspect a example which is a bit more concrete:

  1. #include "foo/bar"

  2. #include <bar>

  The first '#include' directive tells Gcal to load the file 'bar' in
the file directory 'foo' from the actual file directory.  If this fails,
Gcal tries to load this file by using steps 1...4 of the previously
explained mechanism used for searching files (*note File searching
mechanism: x-File-searching-mechanism.).

  The second '#include' directive tells Gcal to load the file 'bar' from
the user respectively system data file directory by using steps 3...4 of
the previously explained mechanism used for searching files.  It is not
allowed to include files which have a fixed access path starting from
the root file directory by such an '#include' directive like
'#include </file>' or '#include </foo/bar/file>'; just as the
specification of a single or an extended file name containing a
disk/drive specifier(3) (*note Include directives-Footnote-3::), because
the resulting path name(4) (*note Include directives-Footnote-4::) would
not be a valid file name any longer.

  Included files may include other files again.  But the nesting level
of included files is limited on the one hand by the amount of usable
working storage of the computer, and on the other hand by the value
which is given by the operating system respectively the compiler for the
number of files which can be opened simultaneously.  Recursive
includes(5) (*note Include directives-Footnote-5::) or cyclic
includes(6) (*note Include directives-Footnote-6::) are not permitted,
because such backward references would produce an infinite loop in the
program internally!  Gcal recognizes such situations and terminates
immediately with a fatal error.  *Note Error Code 119: x-119-Error-code,
for more information.

  If an included resource file cannot be found and no '--debug=abort'
option is given, processing of the resource file containing the
'#include' continues.

   (1) A mechanism similar the method which is used by the C
Preprocessor.

   (2) Thus, a file name which is embraced by '""' or '<>'.

   (3) Even if operating systems like MS-DOS or OS/2 permits such a
disk/drive specification on principle.

   (4) A path name lead by the user respectively system data file
directory name.

   (5) The included file tries to include itself again.

   (6) The included file is included again by another file that occurs
at a deeper place in such a chain.

5.1.8 Date variables
--------------------

Gcal respects _global_ and/or _local_ date variables which may be used
either in the date part of a Gcal resource file line, or which may be
part of a special text in the text part of a Gcal resource file line.
This means, up to *24* user-defined date variables can be set and
referenced during program execution.  *Note Fixed date option
'--date-variable=ARGUMENT': x-date-variable, for more information how
global date variables can be used.

  A date variable name DVAR consists of a single, case-insensitive
letter(1) (*note Date variables-Footnote-1::).  In a definition, this
name is trailed by the assignment operator character '=', and the
numerical values of month MM (or a short, three characters month name,
e.g. 'Jan', 'Feb'...) and day DD, this variable has to store(2) (*note
Date variables-Footnote-2::), e.g.:

     a=1127
     c=a

stores the 27th November into the local date variable A and into the
local date variable C.  You should always remember that date variables
can only be referenced in a line if they are already defined, because
Gcal processes a resource file line by line.

  Only local date variables can store dynamical dates given in the
'MMWWWN', 'DVAR[+|-]N[WWW]' or '*d|wN[WWW]' format, e.g.:

     a=03su2
     b=JunMon9
     c=b-3
     d=c+4Sa
     x=*d10
     y=*d10fri
     z=*w3Su

which means, date variable A stores the date of second Sunday in March
and B stores date of last Monday in June.  The date variable C stores
the date which is three days before the date of the last Monday in June
and this date is set in the date variable D to that date which is four
Saturdays after the date of C.  The date variable X stores the date of
the 10th absolute day of the year (== 10th January).  Y stores the date
of the 10th Friday of the year, and the assignment to Z is the date of
the Sunday which occurs in the 3rd week of the year.

*Caution:*
These kinds of assignments to date variables are *only* computed
correctly in simple year bounds --which means during a current year--
and not in fixed dates shown after the current year has changed, e.g. in
*fiscal years*.

  Date variables which are defined in a resource file are always local
and only respected in this specific file, and that file which is
included by it.  This means for the included file, that *all* local
variables of the caller are visible.  The included file itself may
define its own local variables in its own name-space, which are not
exported to caller on return.  All other definitions of date
variables(3) (*note Date variables-Footnote-3::) are always global.  If
a resource file line contains a reference to a date variable which is
not locally defined in that file, Gcal will try to use the global values
held by this variable.  If this fails because no global definition of
this date variable is given, Gcal will not process this line.  If the
simple '--debug' respectively '--debug=internal' option is given,
informational messages for each undefined date variable will be shown on
the _standard error channel_ (*note Global option '--debug=internal':
x-debug-internal.).  If the '--debug=abort' option is given, the Gcal
program will be aborted with an error code when the first undefined
global date variable reference occurs.  *Note Error Code 113:
x-113-Error-code, and *note Global option '--debug=abort':
x-debug-abort, for further information.

  A local date variable can be deleted.  This means, that this date
variable is no longer valid in its local scope and be undefined
therefore.  So it is possible to use its potentially defined global
value in succeeding lines if this date variable is referenced there.
The following example of the resource file 'dvar-1.rc' elucidates these
facts:

     $ cat dvar-1.rc
     -| ; dvar-1.rc
     -| ;
     -| z=0202
     -| 0@z The local assigned date to `z'
     -| z=
     -| 0@z The global assigned date to `z'
     -| z=0404
     -| 0@z The local assigned date to `z'

So Gcal creates the following output:

     $ gcal %1777 -H no -x -v z=1212 -f ./dvar-1.rc -y
     -|
     -| Sun, Feb   2nd 1777: The local assigned date to `z'
     -| Fri, Apr   4th 1777: The local assigned date to `z'
     -| Fri, Dec  12th 1777: The global assigned date to `z'
     $ gcal %1777 -H no -x -f ./dvar-1.rc -y
     -|
     -| Sun, Feb   2nd 1777: The local assigned date to `z'
     -| Fri, Apr   4th 1777: The local assigned date to `z'

  Only advanced users should apply the '--export-date-variables' option
which causes that the actual incarnation of a local date variable
--which was previously defined in a resource file and not in an included
file-- is being exported to further resource files instead of using its
global value, in case that date variable is not locally defined in that
further resource file.  *Note Include directives::, for more details.

  But be aware, the use of this option could create unwanted results,
because the order of processing the resource files is an important
entity in managing the '--export-date-variables' option, so it is not
recommended to use it.  You, the user, must exactly know what you are
doing when applying this option; *you are expressively warned now!*

Some basic operations can be performed on date variables.  These are:

*Operation*    *Description*
 
'DVAR++'       Simple increment by one day.
'DVAR--'       Simple decrement by one day.
'DVAR+=[+|-]N' Addition of a constant numerical day factor [+|-]N.
'DVAR-=[+|-]N' Subtraction of a constant numerical day factor [+|-]N.
'DVAR+=NWWW'   Addition of N weekdays WWW.
'DVAR-=NWWW'   Subtraction of N weekdays WWW.

  The scope of the operations which are done on a local date variable,
is that resource or include file, where the local date variable is
defined.

  If operations on a global date variable are performed in a resource
file or that file which is included by it, these operations are only
valid in that specific file(4) (*note Date variables-Footnote-4::), not
in further resource files processed.  This means, the initial values of
global date variables are always restored if the resource file changes.

  Please finally note, that each date variable assignment/operation must
be given separately on a single line in the resource file.

   (1) Except the date variable E which is internally reserved for the
Easter Sunday's date, so it cannot be assigned or operated therefore.
And except the date variable T which is internally reserved for today's
date, so it likewise cannot be assigned or operated.

   (2) Or the name of another date variable, which is already defined.

   (3) In the command line, environment variable 'GCAL' or response
file.

   (4) They are only done locally.

5.1.9 Text variables
--------------------

Gcal respects _global_ and/or _local_ text variables which may be used
anywhere in a line of a Gcal resource file.  This means, up to *26*
user-defined text variables can be set and referenced during program
execution.  *Note Fixed date option '--text-variable=ARGUMENT':
x-text-variable, for more information how global text variables can be
used.

A text variable name TVAR consists of the '$' prefix and a single,
case-insensitive letter.

A text variable is defined as follows:

   * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
     operator character '=', all the text which appears at the right
     side of this assignment operator is assigned to this text variable.

   * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
     operator character '?', all the text which appears at the right
     side of this assignment operator is assumed as an external command
     and executed by Gcal.  The output which is created on the _standard
     output channel_ by the command run is assigned to this text
     variable; and that in an interpreted manner.  This means, Gcal
     interprets all special texts and references to other text variables
     that are contained in this output.  *Note Special Texts
     processed::, for further information.

   * If the name of a text variable is trailed by the assignment
     operator character ':', all the text which appears at the right
     side of this assignment operator is assumed as an external command
     and executed by Gcal.  The output which is created on the _standard
     output channel_ by the command run is assigned to this text
     variable; and that in an uninterpreted manner.  This means, Gcal
     does not interpret any special texts and references to other text
     variables that are contained in this output.  See also *note
     Special Texts processed::, for further details.

  Indeed, Gcal executes external commands only if the
'--execute-command' option is given at program start-up.  *Note Fixed
date option '--execute-command': x-execute-command, for more details.

  The text which appears at the right side of one of the valid
assignment operator characters may reference names of already defined
text variables.  These references are converted to the according textual
values just before the assignment is performed by Gcal.  You should
always remember that text variables can only be referenced in a line if
they are already defined, because Gcal processes a resource file line by
line.  Gcal always expands text variable references recursively until
all sub-references to other text variables are resolved.

  Local text variables are set to an _empty value_ and thus defined in a
special mode in case no text appears at the right side of one of the
valid assignment operator characters.

  If a text variable is referenced, an optional format instruction may
be specified between the '$' prefix and the single letter (here: the
variable name), which makes it possible to modify the representation of
the text (here: the contents) at which the text variable points to.  Let
us assume a resource file by the name of 'tvarf-1.rc' exists with the
following contents:

     $ cat tvarf-1.rc
     -| ; tvarf-1.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=123
     -| $b=$:010*a
     -| $c=$b
     -| $b=
     -| 0 1. \$c=.$c.
     -| 0 2. \$c=.$:20*c.
     -| 0 3. \$b=.$>1w*b.
     -| 0 4. \$a=.$>5#a.

So Gcal creates the following output:

     $ gcal -Ux --text-variable='$b=XXX YY' --resource-file=./tvarf-1.rc
     -|
     -| 1. $c=.0000000123.
     -| 2. $c=.      0000000123       .
     -| 3. $b=.Xxx Yy.
     -| 4. $a=.  123.

  *Note Format Instruction::, for the detailed description of the format
instruction and its components.

  You may depreciate the special meaning of the '$' prefix character
--in case this character itself is needed in the text-- by placing a '\'
(backslash) character before it, e.g. '\$'.  If you need the '\$'
characters themselves in the text, you have to protect the '\'
(backslash) character by another '\' (backslash) character, e.g. '\\$'.

  External commands are not directly executed by Gcal, they are executed
by means of the command line interpreter of the operating system, the
shell.  As consequence to this, of course the commands have to be
specified according to the syntax conventions of the used shell,
concerning the grouping conventions, list processing conventions,
redirection conventions et cetera!  For example, it is possible that you
have to write '$a?(cat text)' instead of the simple '$a?cat text'.  See
the pertinent literature for more details.

  If the output of external commands, which appears on the _standard
output channel_, is assigned to text variables in an interpreted manner,
this output is internally directed by Gcal into a temporary file.
Thereafter, the contents of the temporary file is transfered to the text
variable and the temporary file is removed.

  If the output of external commands, which appears on the _standard
output channel_, is assigned to text variables in an uninterpreted
manner, this output is internally processed by the Txt2gcal program
first (*note Invoking 'txt2gcal': Invoking txt2gcal.), and then this
output is directed by Gcal into a temporary file.  Thereafter, the
contents of the temporary file is transfered to the text variable and
the temporary file is removed.  In case a 'TXT2GCALPROG' environment
variable (*note Environment Variable 'TXT2GCALPROG': x-TXT2GCALPROG.) is
defined and set with the file name of the executable Txt2gcal program,
Gcal will use this file name for calling Txt2gcal.  Otherwise, the file
name 'txt2gcal' --which is burned-in during the compilation step of the
Gcal program-- is used for calling the Txt2gcal program.  The
'TXT2GCALPROG' environment variable must always be set if the Txt2gcal
program is installed under another name than the standard name
'txt2gcal', otherwise Gcal is unable to execute the Txt2gcal program
automatically!

  If the simple '--debug' respectively '--debug=internal' option is
given at program start-up, informational messages about the executed
command and its _exit code_ will be shown on the _standard error
channel_ (*note Global option '--debug=internal': x-debug-internal.).

  If the '--debug=abort' option is given, the Gcal program will be
aborted with an error code in case an _exit code_ not equal zero
occurred during the execution of the command.  *Note Error Code 2:
x-2-Error-code, and *note Global option '--debug=abort': x-debug-abort,
for further information.

  Here is an example which explains how the output of external commands
can be assigned to text variables.  Supposing there is a resource file
by the name of 'tvarc-1.rc' with the following contents:

     $ cat tvarc-1.rc
     -| %t  $a $>+06*b $>1u*c

This file is used in the resource file 'tvarc-1a.rc' and processed by
Gcal as follows:

     $ cat tvarc-1a.rc
     -| ; tvarc-1a.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=bonjour
     -| $b=123
     -| $c=bonsoir
     -| $x?cat $f
     -| 0 \$x=---$:30*x---
     -| $y:cat $f
     -| 0 \$y=---$y---
     -| 0 \$y=:::$>1u*y:::
     $ gcal -f tvarc-1a.rc -QUx --exe -r'$f=./tvarc-1.rc'
     -| $x=---    18:54 bonjour +00123 BONSOIR     ---
     -| $y=---%t  $a $>+06*b $>1u*c---
     -| $y=:::%T  $A $>+06*B $>1U*C:::

  Here are some more examples showing how Gcal processes text variables.
Let us assume a resource file by the name of 'tvar-1.rc' exists with the
following contents:

     $ cat tvar-1.rc
     -| ; tvar-1.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=foo
     -| 0 \$a:1=$a
     -| $c=$a
     -| 0 \$c=$c
     -| $b=$c bar $a
     -| 0 \$b=$b
     -| $a=bar $b baz $a booz
     -| 0 \$a:2=$a
     -| $a=
     -| $b=0 $b $c frozz $a frozz
     -| $b ->That's \$b
     -| 0 \$x='$x' and \$d is undefined: $d...
     -| $a= 0 ~ 1~2~\$3~%n~$c~\
     -| now it's enough!
     -| 0 \$a=---$a---
     -| $a=0 \   \ \\ And this...
     -| $a works too!

So Gcal creates the following output:

     $ gcal %19960101 -H no -x -r '$A=FROBOZZ:$x=' -f ./tvar-1.rc
     -|
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996:    \ \\ And this... works too!
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $a:1=foo
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $a:2=bar foo bar foo baz foo booz
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $a=--- 0
     -|                       1
     -|                      2
     -|                      $3
     -|                      01-Jan-1996
     -|                      foo
     -|                      now it's enough!---
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $b=foo bar foo
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $c=foo
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $x='' and $d is undefined: $d...
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: foo bar foo foo frozz FROBOZZ frozz ->That's $b

Or a resource file by the name of 'tvar-2.rc' exists with the following
contents:

     $ cat tvar-2.rc
     -| ; tvar-2.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=$b foo
     -| $b=0@e
     -| $a bar
     -| $b \$b
     -| 0 \$a:$a
     -| 0 \$b:$b

So Gcal creates the following output:

     $ gcal %19960101 -H no -x -f ./tvar-2.rc
     -|
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $a:0@e foo
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996: $b:0@e
     $ gcal %19960101 -H no -x -f ./tvar-2.rc -y
     -|
     -| Sun, Apr   7th 1996: $b
     -| Sun, Apr   7th 1996: foo bar

  As seen before, it is allowed to store complete (or partial) date
parts (*note Date part of a line::), likewise special texts (*note
'%?'... Special Texts: Special Texts processed.) into text variables or
references to other text variables, which are processed by Gcal after
their expansion.  *Note Description of all '%?'... Special Texts:
Special Texts, for limitations concerning the assignment of special
texts to text variables.

  Text variables which are defined in a resource file are always local
and only respected in this specific file, and that file which is
included by it.  This means for the included file, that *all* local
variables of the caller are visible.  The included file itself may
define its own local variables in its own name-space, which are not
exported to caller on return.  All other definitions of text
variables(1) (*note Text variables-Footnote-1::) are always global.  If
a resource file line contains a reference to a text variable which is
not locally defined in that file, Gcal will try to use the global values
held by this variable.  If this fails because no global definition of
this text variable is given, Gcal keeps the name of this text variable
untouched in this line, except this text variable held an _empty value_.
In such a case, Gcal completely ignores this text variable while
processing and displaying instead of keeping its name untouched in this
line.

  An example to this.  Supposing a resource file by the name of
'tvar-3.rc' exists with the following contents:

     $ cat tvar-3.rc
     -| ; tvar-3.rc
     -| ;
     -| $c=+00+000
     -| $h=
     -| $d=$c$h
     -| 0 %o$d  %s$d
     -| 0 \$c=$c  \$h=$h  \$d=$d  \$x=$x

So Gcal creates the following output:

     $ gcal -QUx -f ./tvar-3.rc
     -| $c=+00+000  $h=  $d=+00+000  $x=$x
     -| 05:57 18:04
     $ gcal -QUx -r '$h=+1000:$x=' -f ./tvar-3.rc
     -| $c=+00+000  $h=+1000  $d=+00+000+1000  $x=
     -| 05:52 18:09

  Only advanced users should apply the '--export-text-variables' option
which causes that the actual incarnation of a local text variable
--which was previously defined in a resource file and not in an included
file-- is being exported to further resource files instead of using its
global value, in case that text variable is not locally defined in that
further resource file.  *Note Include directives::, for more details.

  But be aware, the use of this option could create unwanted results,
because the order of processing the resource files is an important
entity in managing the '--export-text-variables' option, so it is not
recommended to use it.  You, the user, must exactly know what you are
doing when applying this option; *you are expressively warned now!*

Some basic operations can be performed on text variables in case they
contain integer values.  These are:

*Operation*    *Description*
 
'TVAR++'       Simple increment by one.
'TVAR--'       Simple decrement by one.
'TVAR+=[+|-]N' Addition of a constant numerical factor [+|-]N.
'TVAR-=[+|-]N' Subtraction of a constant numerical factor [+|-]N.

  Here is an example showing how Gcal processes text variable
operations.  Let us assume a resource file by the name of 'tvaro-1.rc'
exists with the following contents:

     $ cat tvaro-1.rc
     -| ; tvaro-1.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=130
     -| $b=2
     -| 0 1. \$b=$b
     -| $b++
     -| 0 2. \$b=$b
     -| $b+=7
     -| 0 3. \$b=$b
     -| $b--
     -| 0 4. \$b=$b
     -| $b-=-5
     -| 0 5. \$b=$b
     -| $b+=123
     -| 0 6. \$b=$b
     -| $b-=$a
     -| 0 7. \$b=$b
     -| $b-=10000
     -| 0 8. \$b=$b
     -| $b+=10000
     -| 0 9. \$b=$b
     -| $b=02
     -| 0 a. \$b=$b
     -| $b++
     -| 0 b. \$b=$b

So Gcal creates the following output:

     $ gcal -QUx -f ./tvaro-1.rc
     -| 1. $b=2
     -| 2. $b=3
     -| 3. $b=10
     -| 4. $b=09
     -| 5. $b=14
     -| 6. $b=137
     -| 7. $b=007
     -| 8. $b=-9993
     -| 9. $b=00007
     -| a. $b=02
     -| b. $b=03

As you can see in the former example, if operations are made like these,
the default behavior of Gcal is to fill with leading zeroes to preserve
a former length of a text variable, in case a carry into one of the next
decimal places has happened and is taken back by an operation at a later
place in the resource file.  But this default behavior can be disabled
respectively changed by using the already above mentioned format
instruction.

  The scope of the definitions which are done on a local text variable,
is that resource or include file, where the local text variable is
defined.

  If a global text variable is redefined in a resource file or that file
which is included by it, these redefinitions are only valid in that
specific file(2) (*note Text variables-Footnote-2::), not in further
resource files processed.  This means, the initial values of global text
variables are always restored if the resource file changes.

  Please finally note, that each text variable assignment/operation must
be given separately on a single line in the resource file.

   (1) In the command line, environment variable 'GCAL' or response
file.

   (2) They are only done locally.

5.2 Resource file examples
==========================

Here are some examples of problem oriented resource files which might be
useful to get a deeper impression about the attributes of Gcal's fixed
date feature.

  Let us begin with a common example, the resource file 'common.rc':

     $ cat common.rc
     -| ; common.rc, a common example of a resource file.
     -| ;
     -| 19940715 Local time: %t  --> Dentist at 10:00

     -| ;
     -| ; Day of Prayer & Repentance is Wednesday before the Sunday,

     -| ;
     -| a=1225
     -| a=a-5sun
     -| 0@a-4 Day of Prayer & Repentance
     -| ; or
     -| 0@a-1wed Day of Prayer & Repentance

  And here is a resource file by the name of 'demo-1.rc', used to detect
all Fridays the 13th of a year:

     $ cat demo-1.rc
     -| ; demo-1.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=Friday the 13th%i0000
     -| $b=#0000
     -| $c=fri2
     -| $d=fri3
     -| 00000113 $a01$c$b01$c

     -| 00000813 $a08$d$b08$d
     -| 00000913 $a09$c$b09$c
     -| 00000913 $a09$d$b09$d

     -| 00001213 $a12$c$b12$c
     -| 00001213 $a12$d$b12$d

The result for the years 1996...2002 is as follows:

     $ gcal -H no -u -x -f ./demo-1.rc 1996+2002
     -|
     -| Fri, Sep  13th 1996: Friday the 13th
     -| Fri, Dec  13th 1996: Friday the 13th
     -|
     -| Fri, Jun  13th 1997: Friday the 13th
     -|
     -| Fri, Feb  13th 1998: Friday the 13th
     -| Fri, Mar  13th 1998: Friday the 13th
     -| Fri, Nov  13th 1998: Friday the 13th
     -|
     -| Fri, Aug  13th 1999: Friday the 13th
     -|
     -| Fri, Oct  13th 2000: Friday the 13th
     -|
     -| Fri, Apr  13th 2001: Friday the 13th
     -| Fri, Jul  13th 2001: Friday the 13th
     -|
     -| Fri, Sep  13th 2002: Friday the 13th
     -| Fri, Dec  13th 2002: Friday the 13th

  Or a bit shorter version of the resource file 'demo-1.rc' by the name
of 'demo-2.rc', likewise used to detect all Fridays the 13th of a year,
and that by using the fact, that a Friday the 13th only occurs if the
first day of a month is a Sunday:

     $ cat demo-2.rc
     -| ; demo-2.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=%n+12 is a Friday%i0000
     -| $b=#0000
     -| $c=sun1
     -| 00000101 $a01$c$b01$c
     -| 00000201 $a02$c$b02$c
     -| 00000301 $a03$c$b03$c
     -| 00000401 $a04$c$b04$c
     -| 00000501 $a05$c$b05$c
     -| 00000601 $a06$c$b06$c
     -| 00000701 $a07$c$b07$c
     -| 00000801 $a08$c$b08$c
     -| 00000901 $a09$c$b09$c
     -| 00001001 $a10$c$b10$c
     -| 00001101 $a11$c$b11$c
     -| 00001201 $a12$c$b12$c

The result for the years 1996...2002 is as follows:

     $ gcal -H no -u -x -f ./demo-2.rc 1996+2002
     -|
     -| Sun, Sep   1st 1996: 13-Sep-1996 is a Friday
     -| Sun, Dec   1st 1996: 13-Dec-1996 is a Friday
     -|
     -| Sun, Jun   1st 1997: 13-Jun-1997 is a Friday
     -|
     -| Sun, Feb   1st 1998: 13-Feb-1998 is a Friday
     -| Sun, Mar   1st 1998: 13-Mar-1998 is a Friday
     -| Sun, Nov   1st 1998: 13-Nov-1998 is a Friday
     -|
     -| Sun, Aug   1st 1999: 13-Aug-1999 is a Friday
     -|
     -| Sun, Oct   1st 2000: 13-Oct-2000 is a Friday
     -|
     -| Sun, Apr   1st 2001: 13-Apr-2001 is a Friday
     -| Sun, Jul   1st 2001: 13-Jul-2001 is a Friday
     -|
     -| Sun, Sep   1st 2002: 13-Sep-2002 is a Friday
     -| Sun, Dec   1st 2002: 13-Dec-2002 is a Friday

Of course, preceding textual expense for the purpose of detecting all
Fridays the 13th of a year can be dramatically reduced by simply using
of

     0*d1fri#99fri.7 Friday the 13th%i00000013#00000013

in the resource file 'demo-1.rc', respectively,

     0*d1sun#99sun.7 %n+12 is a Friday%i00000001#00000001

in the 'demo-2.rc' resource file.

On the one hand, preceding _one-liners_ reduce the coding expense quite
considerably --from 28 respectively 15 lines to 1 line in each case--,
but on the other hand, this partly increases the checking expense of
these _one-liners_ considerably and result in a longer program run-time
therefore.  Both _one-liners_ produce about 52 internal productions
respectively effective fixed date entries of themselves for each year
checked by Gcal, at which the 'demo-1.rc' and 'demo-2.rc' resource files
cause 24 respectively 12 effective fixed date entries only.
  And here is a resource file by the name of 'demo-3.rc', used to detect
all working-days of any month:

     $ cat demo-3.rc
     -| ; demo-3.rc
     -| ;
     -| $a=%VWork day
     -| $c=%i#0000$b99
     -| a=$bmon1
     -| 0@a#+4 $a
     -| a=$btue1
     -| 0@a#+3 $a
     -| a=$bwed1
     -| 0@a#+2 $a
     -| a=$bthu1
     -| 0@a#+1 $a
     -| a=$bfri1
     -| 0@a $a
     -| a=$bmon2
     -| 0@a#+4 $a
     -| a=$bmon3
     -| 0@a#+4 $a
     -| a=$bmon4
     -| 0@a#+4 $a$c
     -| a=$bmon9
     -| 0@a#+4 $a$c

Respectively a bit shorter version of the resource file 'demo-3.rc':

     ; demo-3.rc
     ;
     $a=%VWork day
     $c=%i#0000$b99
     0000$bmon1:5 $a
     0000$btue1:4 $a
     0000$bwed1:3 $a
     0000$bthu1:2 $a
     0000$bfri1:1 $a
     0000$bmon2:5 $a
     0000$bmon3:5 $a
     0000$bmon4:5 $a$c
     0000$bmon9:5 $a$c

And a resource file by the name of 'include.rc' exists which is only
used to include one given resource file:

     $ cat include.rc
     -| #include "$f"

Then the result for the month August 1996 is as follows:

     $ gcal -H no -u -x -r '$b=08:$f=demo-3.rc' -f ./include.rc Aug 1996
     -|
     -| Thu, Aug   1st 1996: Work day
     -| Fri, Aug   2nd 1996: Work day
     -| Mon, Aug   5th 1996: Work day
     -| Tue, Aug   6th 1996: Work day
     -| Wed, Aug   7th 1996: Work day
     -| Thu, Aug   8th 1996: Work day
     -| Fri, Aug   9th 1996: Work day
     -| Mon, Aug  12th 1996: Work day
     -| Tue, Aug  13th 1996: Work day
     -| Wed, Aug  14th 1996: Work day
     -| Thu, Aug  15th 1996: Work day
     -| Fri, Aug  16th 1996: Work day
     -| Mon, Aug  19th 1996: Work day
     -| Tue, Aug  20th 1996: Work day
     -| Wed, Aug  21st 1996: Work day
     -| Thu, Aug  22nd 1996: Work day
     -| Fri, Aug  23rd 1996: Work day
     -| Mon, Aug  26th 1996: Work day
     -| Tue, Aug  27th 1996: Work day
     -| Wed, Aug  28th 1996: Work day
     -| Thu, Aug  29th 1996: Work day
     -| Fri, Aug  30th 1996: Work day

And of course, the preceding textual expense for the purpose of
detecting all work days of any month can be dramatically reduced by
simply using of

     00000001#0099 %V%rWork day

in the resource file 'demo-3.rc'.

  And next the resource file by the name of 'sun-1.rc' which detects the
actual local time, the approximate time of sunrise and sunset, day and
night length of two geographic locations:

     $ cat sun-1.rc
     -| ; sun-1.rc, comparison of sunrise / sunset, day length and night
     -| ; length of two locations, namely:  Muenster.DE / Bangkok.TH
     -| ; All references are based on Muenster.DE !

     -| $w=+60
     -| ; Starting date of winter time in Germany

  The next example is the resource file 'redir-1.rc' which demonstrates
the use of the shell command '%![ARGUMENT]' special text:

     -| $c=$p %!$c
     -| $g=|txt2gcal - $p
     -| ;
     -| $c $g>$f

The result of succeeding call of Gcal, to which you can also add the
'--debug=all' option for a better understanding of the execution
methods, is as follows:

     $ gcal --exe -QUx -f./redir-1.rc+XX -r'$f=XX:$c=echo $f' -#'0 %!rm $f'
     -| XX

  And finally a resource file by the name of 'swtim-1.rc' which produces
fixed date messages reminding Daylight Saving that are valid since 1981
for the Federal Republic of Germany(1) (*note Resource file
examples-Footnote-1::).

     $ cat swtim-1.rc

Appendix A Genesis of the Gregorian Calendar
********************************************

The nowadays calendar was first formulated in several inaccurate
variations by the Romans based on methods developed by the Babylonians
and Egyptians.  The aim of all these calendars was to harmonize the
cycles of the Moon and the Sun.  During Julius Caesar's reign, January
was falling in autumn so he ordered Sosigenes to make changes to the
calendar.  He added 90 days to the year 46 BC to make up for the
seasonal drift and adjusted the lengths of the months similarly as we
know them to be today.  He introduced the leap year by adding one day to
February every four years.  For the present, the leap year regulation
was made in the way that all four years after the 23rd day in February a
leap day was laid in, so the 24th February occurred twice.  The use of
the leap year was an improvement but not entirely accurate.

  But in the later years, the leap rule was used in the wrong way so
that the errors are corrected by emperor Augustus in the year 8 BC.  A
curious sequel happened on this occasion.  Because Augustus reacted with
great jealousy to all things previously made and propagated by Julius
Caesar, he did not like Caesar's name in the calendar, namely the
today's month of *July*.  Offhandedly he ordered to name another month
to himself and so the month name *August* arose.  Furthermore, Augustus
did not tolerate the fact that his month of birth (the August) was
shorter than Caesar's month in the sense of the periodical sequence of
months with 30 and 31 days.  Consequently, the month of August got 31
days, too.  Due to this modification, the number of days in February
were reduced to 28 and 29 days, respectively, so the 29th February was
designed to be the leap day now.

  This calendar is well known under the term "Julian calendar" and is
based on a plain solar year.  The nominal length of a solar year
(respectively a so-called tropical year) is 365 days, 5 hours, 48
minutes, and 46 seconds.  One 366-day year every four years equates to
an average Julian year of 365 days and 6 hours, consequently to 365.25
days.  This means, every four years, an error of 44 minutes, 56 seconds
was accumulated by this kind of calendar calculation.  Because of this
counting method, the length of the years becomes a bit too long, by more
than 11 minutes.

  By the 16th century, the vernal equinox occurred around March 11,
rather than March 21, by reason of an accumulated error of ten days.
The feast of Easter shifted away more and more from the habitual vernal
date, which must have always been celebrated on an earlier date.  So
Pope Gregory XIII introduced the new style calendar in 1582.  Thursday,
the 4th October 1582, was followed by Friday, the 15th October, by
suppressing the ten days between both dates.  Moreover, he ordained that
years ending in hundreds should not be leap years unless they are
divisible by 400.  Incidentally, the Gregorian reform compensates by 72
hours (3 days) every 400 years.  The actual excess accumulated is 74
hours, 53 minutes and 20 seconds.  The error of 2 hours, 53 minutes and
20 seconds every 400 years accumulates to one day in about 3300 years.
Thereby, the Gregorian year has an average length of 365.2425 days.

  But this "Gregorian calendar" was accepted very slowly by others.
Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately.
Most Protestant countries on the Continent adopted the new calendar
around 1700.  England and the American colonies changed in 1752, by act
of Parliament.  Orthodox Christian countries adopted the Gregorian
calendar later.  Russia was the last European country to do so, after
the communist revolution of 1917.  As a result, the former U.S.S.R.
celebrated the October Revolution (happened on October 25th, 1917) in
the old style calendar on November 7th.

  The era of a world wide uniform calendar is already part of history
today.  The Iran returned to the traditional Mohammedan lunar calendar
in 1979 after removal of the Shah reign.  There are some efforts to
improve our currently valid Gregorian calendar.  Its disadvantages are
the reason why an appointed day is not always on the same week day.
Besides, the month lengths are not equal and the holidays, which have
relations to the feast of Easter, are moved within the calendar from one
year to another.  A very sophisticated suggestion was proposed by the
United Nations, but the international establishment of this suggestions
has failed, since it was resisted by some countries as well as the
churches.

Appendix B Gcal Utilities
*************************

Three small utility programs are part of the Gcal 4.1 package.  The Tcal
program runs the Gcal program with the date set one day ahead.  The
Txt2gcal program creates a verbatim Gcal resource file from a text file,
and in contrast to this, the Gcal2txt program creates a verbatim text
file from a Gcal resource file.

B.1 Invoking 'tcal'
===================

The Tcal program runs the Gcal program with the date of tomorrow's
day(1) (*note Invoking tcal-Footnote-1::).  Its arguments are as
follows:

     tcal [--help | --version] | [--shift=[+|-]NUMBER] [ARGUMENT...]

All given ARGUMENTS are passed unmodified to the Gcal program.  If the
Gcal program shall be called with another date than tomorrow's date,
this desired date can be selected by using the '--shift=[+|-]NUMBER'
option, in which '[+|-]NUMBER' is the distance of days the desired date
is distant from the actual system date (==today).  (Works only for
Gregorian years.)  The '--shift' option must be given before all other
ARGUMENTS that are passed to the Gcal program.

  In case a 'GCALPROG' environment variable (*note Environment Variable
'GCALPROG': x-GCALPROG.) is defined and set with the file name of the
executable Gcal program, Tcal will use this file name for calling Gcal.
Otherwise, the file name 'gcal' --which is burned-in during the
compilation step of the Tcal program-- is used for calling the Gcal
program.  The 'GCALPROG' environment variable must always be set if the
Gcal program is installed under another name than the standard name
'gcal', otherwise Tcal is unable to execute the Gcal program
automatically!  An exit status of 0 means all processing is successfully
done, any other value means an error has occurred.

The program accepts the following options:

'--help'
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

'--version'
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.

'--shift=[+|-]NUMBER'
     Define the displacement in '[+|-]NUMBER' days the desired date is
     distant from the actual date.

   (1) This is equivalent the '--shift=1' option.

B.2 Invoking 'txt2gcal'
=======================

The Txt2gcal program creates a verbatim Gcal resource file from a text
file.  Its arguments are as follows:

     txt2gcal [--help | --version] | [TEXT-FILE|-] [DATE-PART]

If no TEXT-FILE argument is given or/but a single '-' character, the
program reads and processes all input received from the _standard input
channel_.  If no DATE-PART argument is given, Txt2gcal creates a '0' for
the date part.  All results are always shown on the _standard output
channel_.  An exit status of 0 means all processing is successfully
done, any other value means an error has occurred.

The program accepts the following options:

'--help'
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

'--version'
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.

  Here comes an example how to use Txt2gcal.  Let us suppose there is a
text file by the name of 'tdemo-1.txt' with the following contents:

     $ cat tdemo-1.txt
     -|         Hi friends,
     -|
     -| I'm the demo text containing funny characters and character
     -| sequences like ~~ \~ % %% $a $1 %%%\
     -| %\ %s %%foo %bar \%Baz \\~ \~\ and so on...
     -| I'm be anxious how I'll be transformed by `txt2gcal'.
     -|

and Txt2gcal processes this file, redirecting the output to
'tdemo-1.rc':

     $ txt2gcal tdemo-1.txt 0*d1#999 > tdemo-1.rc
     $ cat tdemo-1.rc
     -| 0*d1#999 \        Hi friends,~\
     -| ~\
     -| I'm the demo text containing funny characters and character~\
     -| sequences like \~\~ \\~ % %% \$a $1 %%%\ ~\
     -| %\ \%s %\%foo \%bar \\%Baz \\\~ \\~\ and so on...~\
     -| I'm be anxious how I'll be transformed by `txt2gcal'.~\

then Txt2gcal has now created a new Gcal resource file 'tdemo-1.rc' from
the text file 'tdemo-1.txt'.  Let us finally see, how Gcal will
interpret this new resource file:

     $ gcal %19960101 -H no -Ax -f ./tdemo-1.rc
     -|
     -| Mon, Jan   1st 1996:
     -|         Hi friends,
     -|
     -| I'm the demo text containing funny characters and character
     -| sequences like ~~ \~ % %% $a $1 %%%\
     -| %\ %s %%foo %bar \%Baz \\~ \~\ and so on...
     -| I'm be anxious how I'll be transformed by `txt2gcal'.
     -|

B.3 Invoking 'gcal2txt'
=======================

The Gcal2txt program creates a verbatim text file from a Gcal resource
file.  Its arguments are as follows:

     gcal2txt [--help | --version] | [RESOURCE-FILE|-]

If no RESOURCE-FILE argument is given or/but a single '-' character, the
program reads and processes all input received from the _standard input
channel_.  All results are always shown on the _standard output
channel_.  An exit status of 0 means all processing is successfully
done, any other value means an error has occurred.

  The sense and purpose of Gcal2txt is to retrieve all additional texts,
which are put into the output by means of the Txt2gcal program.

The program accepts the following options:

'--help'
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

'--version'
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.

  Here comes an example how to use Gcal2txt.  For that purpose, let us
use the resource file 'tdemo-1.rc' of the previous section (*note
Invoking 'txt2gcal': Invoking txt2gcal.), which was created by means of
the Txt2gcal program from a text file and which looks like this:

     $ txt2gcal tdemo-1.txt 0*d1#999 > tdemo-1.rc
     $ cat tdemo-1.rc
     -| 0*d1#999 \        Hi friends,~\
     -| ~\
     -| I'm the demo text containing funny characters and character~\
     -| sequences like \~\~ \\~ % %% \$a $1 %%%\ ~\
     -| %\ \%s %\%foo \%bar \\%Baz \\\~ \\~\ and so on...~\
     -| I'm be anxious how I'll be transformed by `txt2gcal'.~\

Now let us see, how this resource file will be processed by Gcal2txt:

     $ gcal2txt tdemo-1.rc
     -|         Hi friends,
     -|
     -| I'm the demo text containing funny characters and character
     -| sequences like ~~ \~ % %% $a $1 %%%\
     -| %\ %s %%foo %bar \%Baz \\~ \~\ and so on...
     -| I'm be anxious how I'll be transformed by `txt2gcal'.

Appendix C Aspects in Internationalization
******************************************

Starting with version 2.00, Gcal is able to display message texts using
any native languages instead of using the English language only, because
parts of the GNU 'gettext' package are integrated into the Software.
*Note Introduction: (gettext)Top, for more details.

  By default, Gcal displays all message texts using the English native
language in case no other native language is wanted.  A so-called
_message catalog_ is read by Gcal at run-time if message texts from
another native language are required.  Gcal 4.1 supports the following
native languages:

*Native Language*        *Language Code*
 
English                  'en'
German                   'de'
French                   'fr'
Dutch                    'nl'
Polish                   'pl'
Russian                  'ru'
Swedish                  'sv'

It is only necessary to set one of the environment variables(1) (*note
Internationalization-Footnote-1::):

1.  'LANGUAGE'
2.  'LC_ALL'
3.  'LC_MESSAGES'
4.  'LANG'

with a language code to select another native language instead of the
English native language.

  Normally, users only have to set the 'LANG' environment variable to
tell Gcal the native language to use at run-time level.  Presuming users
want to run Gcal using the German native language for displaying message
texts, they merely have to execute 'setenv LANG de' (in 'csh') or
'export LANG; LANG=de' (in 'sh') at the shell prompt.  Of course they
could even do this from their '.login' or '.profile' file.  *Note The
User's View: (gettext)Users, for more details.

  As shown above, a simple setting of 'de' in the environment variable
'LANG' is sufficient to enable German message texts.  'de' is the
two-letter language code for the German language defined in the
ISO-639:1988, and is called "simple language code information" in the
further context.  Other language codes can be taken from this
ISO-document(2) (*note Internationalization-Footnote-2::).

  Because Gcal as calendar program must also comply the specifics of a
used native language concerning the ordering of day, month and year (and
further things) of a displayed date, the period of Gregorian
Reformation, the type of week number and the representation of calendar
sheets, these criteria are likewise bound to the language code(3) (*note
Internationalization-Footnote-3::).

A 'en' language code causes the following internal defaults of above
criteria:

   * U.S. American date format

   * Gregorian Reformation has occurred 1752

   * Week starts on Sunday

   * Standard week numbers

   * Representation of calendar sheet

             September 1994
          Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
                       1  2  3
           4  5  6  7  8  9 10
          11 12 13 14 15 16 17
          18 19 20 21 22 23 24
          25 26 27 28 29 30

And a 'de' language code(4) (*note Internationalization-Footnote-4::)
causes the following internal defaults:

   * German date format

   * Gregorian Reformation has occurred 1582

   * Week starts on Monday

   * ISO-8601:1988 week numbers

   * Representation of calendar sheet

          September 1994

          Monday          5 12 19 26
          Tuesday         6 13 20 27
          Wednesday       7 14 21 28
          Thursday     1  8 15 22 29
          Friday       2  9 16 23 30
          Saturday     3 10 17 24
          Sunday       4 11 18 25

  Remember, all these internal defaults are modifiable by the options
'--date-format', '--gregorian-reform', '--starting-day',
'--iso-week-number' and '--type'.

  If no language code is detected, Gcal takes the internal defaults of
the 'en' language code(5) (*note Internationalization-Footnote-5::).

  If a language code is specified for which no _message catalog_ is
installed, Gcal takes the internal defaults of the 'de' language code,
but displays the message texts using the English native language.
Actually, this behavior seems to me the most proper solution in such a
case.  The English native language is spoken all over the world unlike
the German or other native languages, so it is wise to use it here.  But
the other criteria bound to the English native language are so special
for users of other native languages, that it is wise to use the criteria
taken for internal defaults of the 'de' language code, because most
European countries (taken as standard) essentially use them.

  Now British users will certainly ask whether they could use their date
format as an internal default(6) (*note
Internationalization-Footnote-6::).  The answer to this is a simple
'yes', nevertheless, these users have to set the environment variable
'LANG' with an "extended language code information" instead of a simple
language code information.

The usual template of an extended language code information is as
follows:

   * For XPG syntax (X/Open Portability Guide):
          LANGUAGE[_TERRITORY][.CODESET][@MODIFIER]

   * For CEN syntax (Comite' Europe'n de Normalisation):
          LANGUAGE[_TERRITORY][+AUDIENCE][+SPECIAL][,SPONSOR][_REVISION]

  Both syntaxes contain the LANGUAGE and TERRITORY components, which are
used by Gcal to select the native language and the other criteria.  The
LANGUAGE component is equivalent to the simple language code information
and the TERRITORY component is a two-letter territory or country code as
defined by the ISO-3166 like 'GB' for Great Britain or 'US' for the
U.S.A.  See the pertinent literature for more details.  So British users
only have to set the 'LANG' environment variable with a 'en_GB'
contents, and after that, they can use the British date format as an
internal default.

   (1) Listed in decreasing priority as they are respected.

   (2) For example 'fr' for French, 'es' for Spanish...

   (3) Strictly speaking, an extended language code information.

   (4) Or other language codes, for which a _message catalog_ will be
created and distributed in future.

   (5) Or to be more precise, of the extended language code information
'en_US'.

   (6) All other internal defaults of the simple 'en' language code
information just meet their criteria.

Appendix E Regular Expressions
******************************

This appendix is derived from the 'gawk-3.0.0' and 'regex-0.12' manuals.

  A "regular expression", or "regexp", is a way of describing a set of
strings.  The simplest regular expression is a sequence of letters,
numbers, or both.  Such a regexp matches any string that contains that
sequence.  Thus, the regexp 'foo' matches any string containing 'foo'.
Other kinds of regular expressions let you specify more complicated
classes of strings.

  Gcal uses exactly one of the following regular expression programming
libraries respectively methods, and that in the decreasing priority how
it is chosen at configuration time, or better, compile time of the
software:

*No.**Function*                                             *Symbol*
 
1.   GNU 're_compile_pattern()' and 'regex.h'               'GNU-REGEX'
2.   POSIX 'regcomp()' and 'regex.h'                        'POSIX-REGEX'
3.   BSD 're_comp()'                                        'BSD-REGEX'
4.   System V 'regcmp()'                                    'SysV-REGEX'
5.   Henry Spencer V8 'regcomp()' and 'regexp.h'            'V8-REGEX'
6.   Pattern matching is supported, but without             'NO-REGEX'
     metacharacters

Try 'gcal --version' for detecting the kind of regular expression
programming library respectively method that is burned in your Gcal
program!

E.1 How to Use Regular Expressions
==================================

A regular expression can be used as a pattern if Gcal's
'--filter-text=PATTERN' option is specified at program start-up.

  *Note Fixed date option '--filter-text=PATTERN': x-filter-text, for
more details.

  Then the regular expression is tested against the entire, completely
expanded text of each *valid* fixed date, and the fixed date is only
displayed in case the pattern matches the text(1) (*note Regexp
Usage-Footnote-1::).

   (1) Normally, it only needs to match some part of the text in order
to succeed.

E.2 Regular Expression Operators
================================

You can combine regular expressions with the following characters,
called "regular expression operators", or "metacharacters", to increase
the power and versatility of regular expressions.

  Here is a table of these metacharacters.  All characters that are not
listed in the table stand for themselves.

'\'
     This is used to suppress the special meaning of a character when
     matching.  For example:

          \$

     matches the character '$'.

'^'
     This matches the beginning of a string.  For example:

          ^@chapter

     matches the '@chapter' at the beginning of a string, and can be
     used to identify chapter beginnings in Texinfo source files.  The
     '^' is known as an "anchor", since it anchors the pattern to
     matching only at the beginning of the string.

'$'
     This is similar to '^', but it matches only at the end of a string.
     For example:

          p$

     matches a string that ends with a 'p'.  The '$' is also an anchor.

'.'
     The period, or dot, matches any single character.  For example:

          .P

     matches any single character followed by a 'P' in a string.  Using
     concatenation we can make a regular expression like 'U.A', which
     matches any three-character sequence that begins with 'U' and ends
     with 'A'.

'[...]'
     This is called a "character list".  It matches any _one_ of the
     characters that are enclosed in the square brackets.  For example:

          [MVX]

     matches any one of the characters 'M', 'V', or 'X' in a string.

     Ranges of characters are indicated by using a hyphen between the
     beginning and ending characters, and enclosing the whole thing in
     brackets.  For example:

          [0-9]

     matches any digit.  Multiple ranges are allowed.  E.g., the list
     '[A-Za-z0-9]' is a common way to express the idea of "all
     alphanumeric characters."

     To include one of the characters '\', ']', '-' or '^' in a
     character list, put a '\' in front of it.  For example:

          [d\]]

     matches either 'd', or ']'.

     "Character classes" are a new feature introduced in the POSIX
     standard.  A character class is a special notation for describing
     lists of characters that have a specific attribute, but where the
     actual characters themselves can vary from country to country
     and/or from character set to character set.  For example, the
     notion of what is an alphabetic character differs in the U.S.A. and
     in France.

     A character class is only valid in a regexp _inside_ the brackets
     of a character list.  Character classes consist of '[:', a keyword
     denoting the class, and ':]'.  Here are the character classes
     defined by the POSIX standard:

     '[:alnum:]'
          Alphanumeric characters.

     '[:alpha:]'
          Alphabetic characters.

     '[:blank:]'
          Space and tab characters.

     '[:cntrl:]'
          Control characters.

     '[:digit:]'
          Numeric characters.

     '[:graph:]'
          Characters that are printable and are also visible(1) (*note
          Regexp Operators-Footnote-1::).

     '[:lower:]'
          Lower-case alphabetic characters.

     '[:print:]'
          Printable characters(2) (*note Regexp Operators-Footnote-2::).

     '[:punct:]'
          Punctuation characters(3) (*note Regexp
          Operators-Footnote-3::).

     '[:space:]'
          Space characters(4) (*note Regexp Operators-Footnote-4::).

     '[:upper:]'
          Upper-case alphabetic characters.

     '[:xdigit:]'
          Characters that are hexadecimal digits.

     For example, before the POSIX standard, to match alphanumeric
     characters, you had to write '[A-Za-z0-9]'.  If your character set
     had other alphabetic characters in it, this would not match them.
     With the POSIX character classes, you can write '[[:alnum:]]', and
     this will match _all_ the alphabetic and numeric characters in your
     character set.

     Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists.
     These apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single
     symbols (called "collating elements") that are represented with
     more than one character, as well as several characters that are
     equivalent for collating, or sorting, purposes.  (E.g., in French,
     a plain 'e' and a grave-accented 'e`' are equivalent.)

     Collating Symbols
          A "collating symbol" is a multi-character collating element
          enclosed in '[.' and '.]'.  For example, if 'ch' is a
          collating element, then '[[.ch.]]' is a regexp that matches
          this collating element, while '[ch]' is a regexp that matches
          either 'c' or 'h'.

     Equivalence Classes
          An "equivalence class" is a list of equivalent characters
          enclosed in '[=' and '=]'.  Thus, '[[=ee`=]]' is a regexp that
          matches either 'e' or 'e`'.

     These features are very valuable in non-English speaking locales.

     *Caution:*
     The library functions that Gcal uses for regular expression
     matching currently only recognize POSIX character classes
     (possibly); they do not recognize collating symbols or equivalence
     classes.

'[^ ...]'
     This is a "negated character list" respectively "complemented
     character list".  The first character after the '[' _must_ be a
     '^'.  It matches any characters _except_ those in the square
     brackets.  For example:

          [^0-9]

     matches any character that is not a digit.

'|'
     This is the "alternation operator", and it is used to specify
     alternatives.  For example:

          ^P|[0-9]

     matches any string that matches either '^P' or '[0-9]'.  This means
     it matches any string that starts with 'P' or contains a digit.

     The alternation applies to the largest possible regexps on either
     side.  In other words, '|' has the lowest precedence of all the
     regular expression operators.

'(...)'
     Parentheses are used for grouping in regular expressions as in
     arithmetic.  They can be used to concatenate regular expressions
     containing the alternation operator, '|'.  For example,
     '@(samp|code)\{[^}]+\}' matches both '@code{foo}' and '@samp{bar}'.
     (These are Texinfo formatting control sequences.)

'*'
     This symbol means that the preceding regular expression is to be
     repeated as many times as necessary to find a match.  For example:

          ph*

     applies the '*' symbol to the preceding 'h' and looks for matches
     of one 'p' followed by any number of 'h's.  This will also match
     just 'p' if no 'h's are present.

     The '*' repeats the _smallest_ possible preceding expression.  (Use
     parentheses if you wish to repeat a larger expression.)  It finds
     as many repetitions as possible.  For example:

          gcal --filter-text='\(c[ad][ad]*r x\)' -f sample.rc -y

     prints every fixed date in 'sample.rc' containing a fixed date text
     of the form '(car x)', '(cdr x)', '(cadr x)', and so on.  Notice
     the escaping of the parentheses by preceding them with backslashes.

'+'
     This symbol is similar to '*', but the preceding expression must be
     matched at least once.  This means that:

          wh+y

     would match 'why' and 'whhy' but not 'wy', whereas 'wh*y' would
     match all three of these strings.  This is a simpler way of writing
     the last '*' example:

          gcal --filter-text='\(c[ad]+r x\)' -f sample.rc -y

'?'
     This symbol is similar to '*', but the preceding expression can be
     matched either once or not at all.  For example:

          fe?d

     will match 'fed' and 'fd', but nothing else.

'{N}'
'{N,}'
'{N,M}'
     One or two numbers inside braces denote an "interval expression"
     which is available in the POSIX standard.  If there is one number
     in the braces, the preceding regexp is repeated N times.  If there
     are two numbers separated by a comma, the preceding regexp is
     repeated N to M times.  If there is one number followed by a comma,
     then the preceding regexp is repeated at least N times.

     'wh{3}y'
          matches 'whhhy' but not 'why' or 'whhhhy'.

     'wh{3,5}y'
          matches 'whhhy' or 'whhhhy' or 'whhhhhy', only.

     'wh{2,}y'
          matches 'whhy' or 'whhhy', and so on.

  GNU software that deals with regular expressions provides a number of
additional regexp operators.  These operators are described here.

  Most of the additional operators are for dealing with word matching.
For our purposes, a "word" is a sequence of one or more letters, digits,
or underscores ('_').

'\w'
     This operator matches any word-constituent character, i.e. any
     letter, digit, or underscore.  Think of it as a short-hand for
     '[A-Za-z0-9_]' or '[[:alnum:]_]'.

'\W'
     This operator matches any character that is not word-constituent.
     Think of it as a short-hand for '[^A-Za-z0-9_]' or '[^[:alnum:]_]'.

'\<'
     This operator matches the empty string at the beginning of a word.
     For example, '\<away' matches 'away', but not 'stowaway'.

'\>'
     This operator matches the empty string at the end of a word.  For
     example, 'stow\>' matches 'stow', but not 'stowaway'.

'\b'
     This operator matches the empty string at either the beginning or
     the end of a word (the word *b*oundary).  For example, '\bballs?\b'
     matches either 'ball' or 'balls' as a separate word.

'\B'
     This operator matches the empty string within a word.  In other
     words, '\B' matches the empty string that occurs between two
     word-constituent characters.  For example, '\Brat\B' matches
     'crate', but it does not match 'dirty rat'.  '\B' is essentially
     the opposite of '\b'.

  There are two other operators that work on buffers.  In Emacs, a
"buffer" is, naturally, an Emacs buffer.  For other programs, the regexp
library routines that Gcal uses consider the entire string to be matched
as the buffer(5) (*note Regexp Operators-Footnote-5::).

  For Gcal, since '^' and '$' always work in terms of the beginning and
end of strings, these operators do not add any new capabilities.  They
are provided for compatibility with other GNU software.

'\`'
     This operator matches the empty string at the beginning of the
     buffer.

'\''
     This operator matches the empty string at the end of the buffer.

  In regular expressions, the '*', '+', and '?' operators, as well as
the braces '{' and '}', have the highest precedence, followed by
concatenation, and finally by '|'.  As in arithmetic, parentheses can
change how operators are grouped.

  Case is normally significant in regular expressions, both when
matching ordinary characters (i.e. not metacharacters), and inside
character sets.  Thus a 'w' in a regular expression matches only a
lower-case 'w' and not an upper-case 'W'.

  The simplest way to do a case-independent match is to use a character
list: '[Ww]'.  However, this can be cumbersome if you need to use it
often; and unfortunately, it can make the regular expressions harder to
read.  Supplying a want, Gcal offers the '--ignore-case' option which
ignores all case distinctions in both the regular expression and the
completely expanded text of each *valid* fixed date.  *Note Fixed date
option '--ignore-case': x-ignore-case.

   (1) A space is printable, but not visible, while an 'a' is both.

   (2) Characters that are not control characters.

   (3) Characters that are not letter, digits, control characters, or
space characters.

   (4) Such as Space, Tab, and Form-feed, to name a few.

   (5) That is the _text part_ of a Gcal resource file line.

Appendix F Summary of all Regular Expressions
*********************************************

Regular expressions are based on POSIX EREs (Extended Regular
Expressions).  Regexps are composed of characters.  Here is a short-list
of them all:

'C'
     matches the character C (assuming C is none of the characters
     listed below).

'\C'
     matches the literal character C.

'.'
     matches any character.

'^'
     matches the beginning of a string.

'$'
     matches the end of a string.

'[ABC...]'
     matches any of the characters ABC... (character list).

'[[:KEYWORD:]]'
     matches any character in the character class KEYWORD.  Allowable
     classes are 'alnum', 'alpha', 'blank', 'cntrl', 'digit', 'graph',
     'lower', 'print', 'punct', 'space', 'upper', and 'xdigit'.

'[[.ELEMENT.]]'
     matches the multi-character collating ELEMENT.  Gcal does not
     currently support collating symbols.

'[[=LIST=]]'
     matches any of the equivalent characters in LIST.  Gcal does not
     currently support equivalence classes.

'[^ABC...]'
     matches any character except ABC... (negated resp. complemented
     character list).

'R1|R2'
     matches either R1 or R2 (alternation).

'R1R2'
     matches R1, and then R2 (concatenation).

'R+'
     matches one or more R's.

'R*'
     matches zero or more R's.

'R?'
     matches zero or one R's.

'(R)'
     matches R (grouping).

'R{N}'
'R{N,}'
'R{N,M}'
     matches at least N, N to any number, or N to M occurrences of R
     (interval expressions).

'\b'
     matches the empty string at either the beginning or the end of a
     word.

'\B'
     matches the empty string within a word.

'\<'
     matches the empty string at the beginning of a word.

'\>'
     matches the empty string at the end of a word.

'\w'
     matches any word-constituent character (alphanumeric characters and
     the underscore).

'\W'
     matches any character that is not word-constituent.

'\`'
     matches the empty string at the beginning of a buffer(1) (*note
     Regexp Summary-Footnote-1::).

'\''
     matches the empty string at the end of a buffer.

   (1) The same as a _text part_ of a resource file line in Gcal.

Appendix G '%?'... Special Texts
********************************

The '%?'... special texts which can be used in the text part of a Gcal
resource file line can coarsely be separated into three categories.  So
there are special texts used for suppression output of fixed dates in
definite cases.  Others are replaced by particular texts or cause the
shell to start external commands.  *Note '%?'... Special Texts: Special
Texts processed, for a general description of the special texts which
may be used in the text part of a Gcal resource file line.

  Some of these special texts may have an optional format instruction
(called FORMAT in the further context), which affects the representation
of an expanded special text.  *Note Format Instruction::, for the
detailed description of the format instruction and its components.  A
possibly specified FORMAT within special texts which may not have a
format instruction is ignored by Gcal and not displayed in output.

  But Gcal is also able to represent such special texts in a special way
by using a format instruction, and that by using an indirect method.
For displaying, you simply assign the special text exclusively to a text
variable which contains a format instruction.  Nevertheless, it is
important to note that the field width component of the format
instruction is chosen in the way that it refers to the assigned contents
of the text variable, if the format instruction has a fixed format
component.  The contents assigned to the text variable is only the
special text, and not its expanded result.  Gcal has to proceed like
that, because the special text which is hidden in the text variable
could not be used (here: displayed) only for a definite date, but
possibly also for several dates, and that adjusted to each date it is
referenced.  Thus exists a special text in the text variable which has a
definite length, and a format instruction also exists, whose field width
component has to affect the expanded result of the special text.
Indeed, Gcal does not know at the moment when the assignment of the
special text to the text variable is made, of which length the expanded
result will be, because this expansion is made at a much later phase in
the program execution.  So, in such a case, the field width component of
a format instruction should have the length of the special text minimum,
otherwise it is crippled and expanded respectively displayed incorrectly
by the internal methods which effect the expansion.

  Of course, not all possibilities concerning the representation --which
are offered by the format instruction-- are listed here for those
special texts those expanded representation may be affected by an
optional FORMAT instruction, but only some few exemplary.

  And some of these special texts may also have an optional simple or
special date argument (called DATE in the further context) or another
argument (called ARGUMENT in the further context).  The DATE argument
must be given in one of the following date formats in case a special
text is directly trailed by it:

   * 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]'

   * 'YYYY*d|wN[WWW]'

   * 'YYYY@e|t|DVAR[[+|-]N[WWW]]'

  Special texts that may have a DATE argument *must* always be trailed
by a _whitespace_ character which is removed in output, no matter
whether DATE was given or not!

  *Note Summary of all '%?'... Special Texts: Special Texts Summary, for
a short-list of all applicable special texts.

G.1 '%?'... special texts for date exclusion
============================================

'%?'... special texts used for exclusion of points of time or periods of
dates are very useful if they are used together with ranges of days
(*note Ranges of days::).  The complete special text is always
suppressed in output in case the fixed date text must be displayed.

G.1.1 Exclusions with date argument '%?[DATE]' special texts
------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, an "inclusive date" period '%?[DATE]' special text can be
specified with the effect, that only those fixed dates are respected and
displayed which are part of this period.  And the specification of an
"exclusive date" period '%?[DATE]' special text has the effect, that
only those fixed dates are respected and displayed which are not part of
this period.

  Cleverly combined, these special texts offer very effective filtration
capabilities used for the definition of special periods in a highly
flexible manner, for example:

     0*d1#999 Every day of year: from January...August except April\
              %i00001#00008 %e00004#00004
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: from 1991...1993 and from 1996\
              except February 1992 and all September\
              %i1991#1993 %i1996# %e19922#19922 %e00009#00009

G.1.1.1 Inclusive date period '%i[DATE][#[DATE]]' special text
..............................................................

'%i[DATE][#[DATE]]' references an inclusive date period, i.e. all dates
which are part of the specified period are valid and are displayed.  Of
course this means, that all fixed dates which are not part of this
period (not covered by it) are invalid and remain undisplayed therefore.

  The first specified date defines the "starting date" of the fixed
date, i.e. the first date the fixed date may occur.  For the starting
date, the following rules concerning definite omission values are valid,
elucidated by using the 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]' date format:

   * If YYYY is set to '0000', the current year is assumed for the year.

   * If MM is not given, then '01' (==January) is assumed for the month.

   * If MM is set to '00', the current month is assumed for the month,
     and the December is assumed in case MM is set to '99'.

   * If DD|WWW is not given, then '01' is assumed for the day.

   * If DD is set to '00', the current day is assumed for the day, and
     the last day of the month MM is assumed in case DD is set to '99'.

   * If the N field is given (range '1...5' or '9'), then a WWW field
     must also be specified.

  The second specified date defines the "ending date" of the fixed date,
i.e. the last date the fixed date may occur.  For the ending date, the
following rules concerning definite omission values are valid, likewise
elucidated by using the 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]' date format:

   * If YYYY is set to '0000', the current year is assumed for the year.

   * If MM is not given, then '12' (==December) is assumed for the
     month.

   * If MM is set to '00', the current month is assumed for the month,
     and the December is assumed in case MM is set to '99'.

   * If DD|WWW is not given, the last day of the month MM is assumed for
     the day.

   * If DD is set to '00', the current day is assumed for the day, and
     the last day of the month MM is assumed in case DD is set to '99'.

   * If the N field is given (range '1...5' or '9'), then a WWW field
     must also be specified.

  The preceding rules are analogously valid for the other permitted date
formats.

  If the starting date, which is encoded in the '%i...' special text, is
later the ending date, the '%i...' special text will be ignored.

  In case neither the starting date nor the ending date is specified,
means only '%i' is given, the implicit period 1st January 1...31st
December 9999 (00010101...99991231) will be used.

  If only the starting date is specified, means either '%iDATE' or
'%iDATE#' is given, the implicit ending date 31st December 9999
(99991231) will be used.

  In case only the ending date is specified, means '%i#DATE' is given,
the implicit starting date 1st January 1 (00010101) will be used.

  For example:

     0d*1#999 Every day of year: only April and July\
              %i00004#00004 %i00007#00007
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: from January...October\
              %i#000010
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: from August 1990\
              %i19908
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: from August...December\
              %i00008
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: only today%i0@t#0@t

G.1.1.2 Exclusive date period '%e[DATE][#[DATE]]' special text
..............................................................

'%e[DATE][#[DATE]]' references an exclusive date period, i.e. all dates
which are part of the specified period are invalid and remain
undisplayed therefore.  Of course this means, that all fixed dates which
are not part of this period (not covered by it) are valid and are
displayed.

  The first specified date defines the starting date of the fixed date,
i.e. the first date the fixed date may occur.  For the starting date,
the following rules concerning definite omission values are valid,
elucidated by using the 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]' date format:

   * If YYYY is set to '0000', the current year is assumed for the year.

   * If MM is not given, then '01' (==January) is assumed for the month.

   * If MM is set to '00', the current month is assumed for the month,
     and the December is assumed in case MM is set to '99'.

   * If DD|WWW is not given, then '01' is assumed for the day.

   * If DD is set to '00', the current day is assumed for the day, and
     the last day of the month MM is assumed in case DD is set to '99'.

   * If the N field is given (range '1...5' or '9'), then a WWW field
     must also be specified.

  The second specified date defines the ending date of the fixed date,
i.e. the last date the fixed date may occur.  For the ending date, the
following rules concerning definite omission values are valid, likewise
elucidated by using the 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]' date format:

   * If YYYY is set to '0000', the current year is assumed for the year.

   * If MM is not given, then '12' (==December) is assumed for the
     month.

   * If MM is set to '00', the current month is assumed for the month,
     and the December is assumed in case MM is set to '99'.

   * If DD|WWW is not given, the last day of the month MM is assumed for
     the day.

   * If DD is set to '00', the current day is assumed for the day, and
     the last day of the month MM is assumed in case DD is set to '99'.

   * If the N field is given (range '1...5' or '9'), then a WWW field
     must also be specified.

  The preceding rules are analogously valid for the other permitted date
formats.

  If the starting date, which is encoded in the '%e...' special text, is
later the ending date, the '%e...' special text will be ignored.

  In case neither the starting date nor the ending date is specified,
means only '%e' is given, the implicit period 1st January 1...31st
December 9999 (00010101...99991231) will be used.

  If only the starting date is specified, means either '%eDATE' or
'%eDATE#' is given, the implicit ending date 31st December 9999
(99991231) will be used.

  In case only the ending date is specified, means '%e#DATE' is given,
the implicit starting date 1st January 1 (00010101) will be used.

  For example:

     0d*1#999 Every day of year: except April and July\
             %e00004#00004 %e00007#00007
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: except January...October\
              %e#000010
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: until July 1990\
              %e19908
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: except August...December\
              %e00008
     ;
     0*d1#999 Every day of year: except today%e0@t#0@t

G.1.2 Exclusions without any argument '%?' special texts
--------------------------------------------------------

First of all, an "inclusive day" period '%?' special text can be
specified with the effect, that only those fixed dates are respected and
displayed which are part of this period.  And the specification of an
"exclusive day" period '%?' special text has the effect, that only those
fixed dates are respected and displayed which are not part of this
period.

  Cleverly combined, these special texts also offer very effective
filtration capabilities used for the definition of very special periods.

  For example:

     0*d1#999 Every day of year: all Mondays...Fridays\
              except Wednesdays and all legal holidays\
              %r%F%V
     ;
     00001001#9999 Every day in last quarter of year: all holidays\
                   which are not on a Sunday%x %P

G.1.2.1 Inclusive day period '%?' special texts
...............................................

The following inclusive day periods '%?' special texts are respected, at
which _inclusive_ is meant for the period which is not excluded.

'%v'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is not listed as legal holiday in
     the _eternal holiday list_.

'%x'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is neither listed as legal holiday
     nor memorial day in the _eternal holiday list_.

'%a'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Monday.

'%c'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Tuesday.

'%f'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Wednesday.

'%g'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Thursday.

'%h'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Friday.

'%l'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Saturday.

'%p'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Sunday.

'%q'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Monday...Thursday.

'%r'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is no Monday...Friday.

G.1.2.2 Exclusive day period '%?' special texts
...............................................

The following exclusive day periods '%?' special texts are respected, at
which _exclusive_ is meant for the period which is excluded.

'%V'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is listed as legal holiday in the
     _eternal holiday list_.

'%X'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is either listed as legal holiday or
     memorial day in the _eternal holiday list_.

'%A'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Monday.

'%C'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Tuesday.

'%F'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Wednesday.

'%G'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Thursday.

'%H'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Friday.

'%L'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Saturday.

'%P'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Sunday.

'%Q'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Monday...Thursday.

'%R'
     Excludes fixed date in case it is a Monday...Friday.

G.2 '%?'... special texts for text replacement
==============================================

'%?'... special texts which are replaced by particular texts at program
run-time causes the interspersing of data into the fixed date text,
which quality is essentially depending on the command line arguments
given for running the program.  The complete special text is always
replaced accordingly in output if the fixed date text must be displayed.

  Cleverly combined, these special texts also offer very effective
mechanisms used for the definition of particular texts in a highly
flexible manner, for example:

     0*d1#999 Every day of year: Today is %K, the %n (%N)

G.2.1 Replacements with date argument '%?[DATE]' special texts
--------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from different representations of a weekday name, it is possible
to create its weekday number.  Likewise, the current day-of-year number,
the day number, the week number, the month name, the month number, the
year number, the Moon phase, the biorhythm, and some useful difference
values can be produced.

  For the DATE argument these '%?[DATE]' special text may have, the
following rules concerning definite omission values are valid,
elucidated by using the 'YYYY[MM[DD|WWWN]]' date format(1) (*note
Replacements with date argument-Footnote-1::):

   * If YYYY... is not given (==*no* date encoded), the current year is
     assumed for the date.

   * If YYYY is set to '0000', the current year is assumed for the year.

   * If MM is not given or set to '00', the current month is assumed for
     the month, and the December is assumed in case MM is set to '99'.

   * If DD|WWW is not given or set to '00', the current day is assumed
     for the day, and the last day of the month is assumed in case DD is
     set to '99'.

   * If the N field is given (range '1...5' or '9'), then a WWW field
     must also be specified.

   (1) The succeeding rules are analogously valid for the other
permitted date formats.

          ==> 'Moon phase 098%+, 23-Dec-1996', in case the actual system
          date is the 22nd December 1996.

     The constructed Moon phase text consists of a percent value, which
     informs about the illuminated fraction of the Moon's disk, and a
     trailing sign that tells something about the state of the Moon.  A
     trailing '+' sign indicates a waxing Moon, a '-' sign a waning
     Moon, a '@' sign indicates the Full Moon phase, and a '!' sign the
     New Moon phase.

'%Z[DATE]'
     Is replaced by the *Moon phase text graphics* of the current day of
     year, e.g.:

          The text 'Date %n %Z  --- Moon phase %>03*O ~Text' will be
          expanded to
          ==> 'Date 08-Mar-1995 '
          ==> '           (       @@@@@@'
          ==> '      (              @@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '    (                @@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '  (                   @@@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> ' (                    @@@@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '(                      @@@@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '(                      @@@@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> ' (                    @@@@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '  (                   @@@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '   (                  @@@@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '      (             @@@@@@@@@'
          ==> '           (        @@@@@@@ --- Moon phase 041%+'
          ==> 'Text', in case the actual system date is the 8th March
          1995.

     *Note Fixed date option '--moonimage-lines=NUMBER':
     x-moonimage-lines, how to change the size of a Moon phase text
     graphics.

     A possibly specified FORMAT within this special text is ignored by
     Gcal.

G.2.1.10 Biorhythm '%?[DATE]' special texts
...........................................

Gcal is able to create a "biorhythm" for any specified date of birth.
The created text shows the three standard biorhythm cycles, and that are
the 28 day emotional cycle, the 33 day intellectual cycle, and the 23
day physical cycle.  The emotional cycle governs sensibility, nerves,
moodiness, and creative ability.  The intellectual cycle reflects
intelligence, memory, mental alertness, and reasoning power.  The
physical cycle represents physical strength, endurance, energy and
resistance.  All cycles start in the zero point at the date of birth and
swing like sine curves between their positive and negative maximum
values.  The periods above the zero point show the days of full vitality
and efficiency while the periods below the zero point indicate days of
reduced efficiency.  The biorhythm is implemented for entertaining
purposes only!  It is up to the user to interpret the biorhythm texts.

  Gcal counts "critical" days, "positive" likewise "negative" days.
Critical days are those days in which one or more of the biological
cycles crosses the zero point.  At that time, one's system is said to be
in a state of flux and it may be desirable to exhibit caution.  Positive
days are those days in which one or more of the biological cycles have a
positive maximum value.  At that time, one's system is said to be in a
raised state.  Negative days are those days in which one or more of the
biological cycles have a negative maximum value.  At that time, one's
system is said to be in a lessen state.

  The following biorhythm '%?[DATE]' special texts are respected:

'%,[DATE]'
     Is replaced by the *biorhythm text* of the current day of year,
     e.g.:

          The text '%,19620921' will be expanded to
          ==> '1! 0+ 0- , Emo=+022%- Int=-091%+ Phy=-014%-', in case the
          actual system date is the 12th December 1996.

     The preceding example shows the calculated biorhythm expressed as a
     series of values for a person born in 1962, September 21st.  The
     constructed text consists of two parts, and that is on the one hand
     a triplet of total values which indicate the critical, positive and
     negative day.  And on the other hand a triplet of values which
     indicate the emotional, intellectual and physical cycle.

     In the first triplet of total values, a '!' suffix means a critical
     day, a '+' indicates a positive day, and a '-' suffix marks a
     negative day.

     In the second triplet of values, each single cycle percent value
     consists of a leading positive or negative sign that tells
     something about the distance of this value to the zero point, and a
     trailing character that tells something about the state of each
     cycle.  A trailing '+' character marks a waxing phase, a '-' suffix
     means a waning phase, and a '@' indicates the maximum value of a
     phase.

'%;[DATE]'
     Is replaced by the *biorhythm text graphics* of the current day of
     year, e.g.:

          The text '%;19620921' will be expanded to
          ==> '0-  I               P 1   E                +0', in case
          the actual system date is the 12th December 1996.

     The preceding example shows the calculated biorhythm expressed as a
     text graphics line for a person born in 1962, September 21st.  The
     constructed line is a bar with a negative and positive axis of
     adjustable length (*note Fixed date option
     '--biorhythm-axis=NUMBER': x-biorhythm-axis.), which left margin is
     represented by the total value of the negative days (the '0-' in
     this case), and which right margin is represented by the total
     value of the positive days (the '+0' in this case).  The zero point
     of the co-ordinate is represented by the total value of the
     critical days, which is the '1' in this case.  The emotional,
     intellectual and the physical phase value is accordingly placed in
     scaled manner on this bar, and that by using the initial letter of
     the cycle in each case ('E', 'I' and 'P').  Coincidental phase
     values are marked by a '@' character.

G.2.1.11 Difference value '%[FORMAT]?[DATE]' special texts
..........................................................

The following difference value '%[FORMAT]?[DATE]' special texts are
respected:

'%yDATE'
     Is replaced by a *year difference value*, e.g.:

          The text 'Sylvester 1912 is %y1912  years ago' will be
          expanded to
          ==> 'Sylvester 1912 is -82 years ago', in case the year of the
          actual system date is 1994.

'%B[DATE]'
     Is replaced by an *age value*, e.g.:

          The text 'My %B1962  birthday%i1952#2062' will be expanded to
          ==> 'My 32 birthday', in case the year of the actual system
          date is 1994.

     Those age values are only displayed, if the computation of an age
     value is greater zero.  The fixed date warning in preceding example
     is displayed only in case the current year is greater than 1952 and
     less than 2062.

'%>1&*B[DATE]'
     Is replaced by an *age value* with trailing Ordinal Number suffix,
     e.g.:

          The text 'My %>1&*B1962  birthday%i1952#2062' will be expanded
          to
          ==> 'My 32nd birthday', in case the year of the actual system
          date is 1994.

     Those age values are only displayed, if the computation of an age
     value is greater zero.  The fixed date warning in preceding example
     is displayed only in case the current year is greater than 1952 and
     less than 2062.

G.2.2 Replacements with other argument '%[FORMAT]?[ARGUMENT]' special texts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from different representations of the actual system time, a fixed
format date text can be created.  Moreover, it is possible to produce a
day number, which bears the Julian date as base date and which can be
deferred if needed.  Furthermore, the approximate distance and the
course angle between two geographic point locations, and different Sun
and Moon oriented data and times for at pleasure any geographical
location can be created.  It is also possible to display the contents of
environment variables in the fixed date text.

  For the ARGUMENT these '%?[ARGUMENT]' special texts may have, no
special rules concerning definite omission values are valid.

G.2.2.1 Actual clocktime '%[FORMAT]?[ARGUMENT]' special texts
.............................................................

Gcal is able to represent the actual clocktime as local/zone time and as
Universal time (UTC/GMT), and additionally the RFC-822(1) (*note Actual
clocktime-Footnote-1::) style numerical Universal time timezone offset
value and the actual numerical local time timezone offset value.  *Note
Actual local time '%t[ARGUMENT]' special text: x-Actual-local-time, for
the detailed description of all components of the ARGUMENT, which may
trail the actual clocktime '%[FORMAT]?[ARGUMENT]' special texts.  All
actual clocktime '%[FORMAT]?[ARGUMENT]' special texts *must* always be
trailed by a _whitespace_ character which is removed in output!  The
following actual clocktime '%[FORMAT]?[ARGUMENT]' special texts are
respected:

'%t[ARGUMENT]'

     '%t[*][[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual local time*,
     which is displayed by using the 'HH:MM' output format, e.g.:

          The text 'Local time: %t  --> Dentist at 10:00' will be
          expanded to
          ==> 'Local time: 07:32 --> Dentist at 10:00', in case the
          actual local time value is 07:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     If only '%t' is specified, the local time value will implicitly be
     displayed by using the _24-hours_ format.  For displaying using the
     _12-hours_ format, add a '*' character directly behind '%t', e.g.
     '%t*'.

     A displacement value may trail the '%t' special text, which has to
     be specified either by using the '[+|-]MMMM' format or the
     '[+|-]HH:[MM]' format.  '[+|-]MMMM' adds respectively subtracts the
     specified amount of minutes MMMM from the local time value (range
     '0...9999'), while '[+|-]HH:[MM]' adds respectively subtracts the
     given amount of hours HH (range '0...99') and minutes MM (range
     '0...59') from the local time value.  The displacement value is
     always added to the local time value in case it is specified
     without a '+|-' sign.  In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual
     local time in 'HH:MM' format by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT,
     a '??:??' text will be created instead of the actual local time in
     'HH:MM' format.

          The text 'Local time: %t-3:  --> Dentist at 10:00' will be
          expanded to
          ==> 'Local time: 04:32 --> Dentist at 10:00', in case the
          actual local time value is 07:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

'%[FORMAT]'[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT]'[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual local time
     in minutes since midnight*, which is displayed by using the M[M...]
     output format, e.g.:

          The text 'Local time: %'  --> Dentist at 10:00' will be
          expanded to
          ==> 'Local time: 452 --> Dentist at 10:00', in case the actual
          local time value is 07:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual local time in M[M...]
     format by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text will be
     created instead of the actual local time in M[M...] format.

'%[FORMAT]_[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT]_[*][[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual local
     time hour*, which is displayed by using the H[H...] output format,
     e.g.:

          The text 'Local time hour: %_-1:' will be expanded to
          ==> 'Local time hour: 6' in case the actual local time value
          is 07:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual local time hour by
     reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text will be created
     instead of the actual local time hour H[H...].

'%[FORMAT]?[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT]?[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual local time
     minute*, which is displayed by using the M[M...] output format,
     e.g.:

          The text 'Local time minute: %>04*?+:2' will be expanded to
          ==> 'Local time minute: 0034' in case the actual local time
          value is 07:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual local time minute by
     reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text will be created
     instead of the actual local time minute M[M...].

'%[FORMAT]{[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT]{[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual local time
     12-hour format suffix*, which is displayed as 'am|pm', e.g.:

          The text 'Local time suffix: %{' will be expanded to
          ==> 'Local time suffix: am' in case the actual local time
          value is 07:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual local time 12-hour
     format suffix by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text
     will be created instead of the actual local time 12-hour format
     suffix 'am|pm'.

'%@[ARGUMENT]'

     '%@[*][[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual Universal time*
     (UTC/GMT), which is displayed by using the 'HH:MM/DATE' output
     format, e.g.:

          The text 'Universal time: %@*-3.' will be expanded to
          ==> 'Universal time: 03:32am/15-Feb-1999', in case the actual
          date is the 15th February 1999 and the actual Universal time
          value is 06:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual Universal time in
     'HH:MM/DATE' format by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a
     '??:??/??-???-????' text will be created instead of the actual
     Universal time in 'HH:MM/DATE' format.

'%[FORMAT]`[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT]`[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual Universal
     time in minutes since midnight*, which is displayed by using the
     'M[M...]/DATE' output format, e.g.:

          The text 'Universal time: %>06*`-3:' will be expanded to
          ==> 'Universal time: 000212/15-Feb-1999' in case the actual
          date is the 15th February 1999 and the actual Universal time
          value is 06:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual Universal time in
     'M[M...]/DATE' format by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a
     '??/??-???-????' text will be created instead of the actual
     Universal time in 'M[M...]/DATE' format.

'%[FORMAT].[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT].[*][[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual Universal
     time hour*, which is displayed by using the H[H...] output format,
     e.g.:

          The text 'Universal time hour: %.-1:' will be expanded to
          ==> 'Universal time hour: 5' in case the actual Universal time
          value is 06:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual Universal time hour by
     reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text will be created
     instead of the actual Universal time hour H[H...].

'%[FORMAT]/[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT]/[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual Universal
     time minute*, which is displayed by using the M[M...] output
     format, e.g.:

          The text 'Universal time minute: %>04*/+:2' will be expanded
          to
          ==> 'Universal time minute: 0034' in case the actual Universal
          time value is 06:32 o'clock ('HH:MM').

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual Universal time minute
     by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text will be created
     instead of the actual Universal time minute M[M...].

'%[FORMAT]}[ARGUMENT]'

     '%[FORMAT]}[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the *actual Universal
     time 12-hour format suffix*, which is displayed as 'am|pm', e.g.:

          The text 'Universal time suffix: %>1w*}+10:' will be expanded
          to
          ==> 'Universal time suffix: Pm' in case the actual Universal

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual Universal time 12-hour
     format suffix by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text
     will be created instead of the actual Universal time 12-hour format
     suffix 'am|pm'.

'%"[ARGUMENT]'

     '%"[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the RFC-822 style *numerical
     Universal time timezone offset value*, which is displayed by using
     the '+|-HHMM' output format, e.g.:

          The text 'Universal time timezone offset value: %"-90' will be
          expanded to
          ==> 'Universal time timezone offset value: -0130', at which
          calculations are always based on the timezone of the Universal
          time UTC/GMT.

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the numerical Universal time
     timezone offset value by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a
     '+????' text will be created instead of the numerical Universal
     time timezone offset value '+|-HHMM'.

'%=[ARGUMENT]'

     '%=[[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]' references the RFC-822 style *actual
     numerical local time timezone offset value*, which is displayed by
     using the '+|-HHMM' output format, e.g.:

          The text 'Local time timezone offset value CET: %=-10' will be
          expanded to
          ==> 'Local time timezone offset value CET: +0050', in case the
          actual timezone is equal the Central European (winter)time
          CEWT/CET ('+HHMM').  Calculations are always based on the
          timezone of the local time.

     In case Gcal is unable to compute the actual numerical local time
     timezone offset value by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a
     '+????' text will be created instead of the actual numerical local
     time timezone offset value '+|-HHMM'.

   (1) RFC is the abbreviation of 'Request for Comments'.

G.2.2.2 Textual date '%n[ARGUMENT]' special text
................................................

'%n[[+|-]N]' references the current respectively queried *day number*
relative to the current date '+/-' N days and is replaced by a *date
text* by using the fixed '%>02*D-%>3#U-%>04*Y' format, e.g.:

     The resource file line '1962Sep21 10000 days old: %n+10000' will be
     expanded to
     ==> '10000 days old: 06-Feb-1990', in case you call Gcal with the
     simple '-c' option and the command 'sep 1962' (*note Single command
     'MM YYYY': x-mm-yyyy.).

G.2.2.3 Julian day number '%[FORMAT]j[ARGUMENT]' special text
.............................................................

'%[FORMAT]j[[+|-]N]' references the current respectively queried *Julian
day number* relative to the actual system date (==today).  This day
number is based on the date 1st January 4713 BCE --which is the starting
day zero of a consecutive day counting used in astronomical
computations-- and is known as the Julian Date (J.D.).  The real zero of
this date is at 12 o'clock Universal time (UTC/GMT); the day does not
change at midnight, but at noon Universal time.  Here, Gcal does not
evaluate the timezone returned by the systems date function.  For that
reason, this day number is represented without a time fraction on the
supposition that the day has already changed at noon.  If you do not
like the feature that the day displayed has already changed at noon, you
can decrease the resulting Julian day number of that special text always
by one, e.g. '%j-1'.

  For example:

     The resource file line '0 Julian day %j since 01-Jan-4713 BCE' will
     be expanded to
     ==> 'Julian day 2437929 since 01-Jan-4713 BCE', in case you call
     Gcal with the '-c %19620921' option and no command.

  If the '%[FORMAT]j' text is directly trailed by an unsigned number,
this number is always subtracted from the real Julian day number.  So
you are able to work with any quantities referenced, e.g.:

     The resource file line '0 Julian day %j2415021 since 01-Jan-1900'
     will be expanded to
     ==> 'Julian day 4 since 01-Jan-1900', in case you call Gcal with
     the '-c %19000105' option and no command.

G.2.2.4 Geographical distance and course angle '%[FORMAT]bARGUMENT' special text
................................................................................

'%[FORMAT]b[*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-1/ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-2'
references either the approximate *air line distance* or the approximate
*course angle (true track)*(1) (*note Geographical distance and course
angle-Footnote-1::) between any of two geographic point locations.  The
selection, which value has to be calculated by using this special text
is done by specifying the MODE part of the preceding argument.
Actually, exactly three different modes can be used that are represented
by the '0'...'2' characters:

*Mode*      *Description*
 
'0'         Calculates the air line distance between
            ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-1 and
            ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-2.  The calculated air line
            distance value is displayed in kilometers by default.  A
            '*' character directly before this mode character causes
            Gcal to display the distance value for another quantity,
            and that in "statute miles"; where one statute mile is
            equal to 1.609344 kilometer.  If Gcal is unable to compute
            the approximate distance between the two geographic point
            locations by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??' text
            will be created instead of the distance value.
 
'1'         Calculates the course angle (true track) between
            ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-1 and
            ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-2.  The calculated course angle
            value is displayed in degrees and arcminutes by default.
            The course angle is measured clockwise relative to the
            geographic, true North (not the magnetic North as shown by
            a compass), where angle values for the North direction are
            both denoted as 0 degree and 360 degree.  A '*' character
            directly before this mode character causes Gcal to display
            the course angle value using another style; and that in
            decimal degrees.  If Gcal is unable to compute the
            approximate course angle between the two geographic point
            locations by reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '???d??''
            text will be created instead of the course angle value.
 
'2'         Like mode '1', but the course angle (true track) between
            ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-2 and ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-1
            is calculated.

  If no MODE is given, Gcal automatically uses that mode, which is
enabled by the mode character '0'.  If a mode character is given that is
not according to one of the '0'...'2' characters, Gcal also
automatically uses that mode, which is enabled by the mode character
'0'.

  After the optional style and mode characters, the latitude and
longitude of the geographic co-ordinates follows, for which the
calculations must be made.  They must be conform the ISO-6709:1983
standard representation of latitude and longitude for geographic point
locations.  The two co-ordinates have to be separated by a '/'
termination character from each other.

  *Note Arguments of the Sun oriented special texts: x-Sun-arguments,
for the detailed description of the components of the ISO-6709:1983
standard representation of latitude and longitude for geographic point
locations.

  For example:

     The text 'Distance Paris-Tokyo: %b+4852+00220/+3542+13946 km' will
     be expanded to
     ==> 'Distance Paris-Tokyo: 9746km'.

     The text 'Distance Paris-Tokyo: %b*0+4852+00220/+3542+13946 ms'
     will be expanded to
     ==> 'Distance Paris-Tokyo: 6056ms'.

     The text 'Course angle Paris-Tokyo: %b1+4852+00220/+3542+13946'
     will be expanded to
     ==> 'Course angle Paris-Tokyo: 033d22''.

     The text 'Course angle Tokyo-Paris: %b*2+4852+00220/+3542+13946'
     will be expanded to
     ==> 'Course angle Tokyo-Paris: 333.548'.

  While praying, people of Islamic faith always turn their heads into
the direction of Makkah, Saudi-Arabia.  Now by means of Gcal, these
people can easily find out for their respective location, where they
have to turn to, and that by:

     %b1ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-1/+212516+0394929

where ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE-1 is simply replaced by the co-ordinate
of the respective location.

   (1) The course angle gives the direction, which is the vertex of a
great circles arc ("Orthodrome") that is casted between two points on a
surface of a sphere, at a meridian (Gcal uses a geoid (rotation
ellipsoid) that is calculated taking pattern from the 'World Geodetic
System', short W.G.S, that was designed in 1961).  Such an arc is the
shortest geodetic connecting line between two points on a sphere.
Indeed, the course angles on such an arc are changing continually,
because the circular line that is casted intersects each meridian with
another angle -- except the case, that both co-ordinates are referring
to exactly the same "meridian" (longitude), or to exactly the same
latitude.

  All these special texts can be used for at pleasure any geographic
point location, i.e. it is possible to determine different astronomical
values for any location on the globe, and that for at pleasure any
clocktime with a resolution of a single minute within the period of the
years AD 1 until AD 9999, that is respected by Gcal.

  The selection which value has to be calculated by these special texts
is done by specifying the MODE part of the preceding argument.
Actually, exactly 54 different modes can be used that are represented by
the '0'...'9', 'a'...'z' and 'A'...'R' characters, and which create
different kind of results that are depending on the special text used.
First of all, here is a table in which all usable modes are described
and explained sufficiently.  You can also see from this table, which Sun
oriented special text or texts are corresponding to which mode, i.e.
cause the determination of an astronomical value as it is described in
the table:

'0'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate midnight time of the
                      Sun.  The astronomical midnight time of the Sun is
                      at that clocktime, when the Sun holds an "azimuth"
                      (horizontal angular distance between the vertical
                      circle, that passes the Sun, and the North point)
                      of either precisely 0 degrees of precisely 180
                      degrees ("noon line"), which depends on the season
                      and the geographical location.  At that clocktime,
                      the Sun is close its "lowest culmination point",
                      i.e. close the lowest point below or above the
                      horizontal plane the Sun transits during this day.
 
'1'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate noon time of the Sun.
                      The astronomical noon time of the Sun is at that
                      clocktime, when the Sun holds an azimuth of either
                      precisely 180 degrees of precisely 0 degrees (noon
                      line), which depends on the season and the
                      geographical location.  At that clocktime, the Sun
                      is close its "highest culmination point", i.e.
                      close the highest point above or below the
                      horizontal plane the Sun transits during this day.
                      People of Islamic faith normally pray for the
                      second time on the day during the period, which is
                      between the astronomical noon time of the Sun (or
                      some minutes later) and the Islamic prayer time by
                      the name of "Asr".  These people commonly use the
                      term "Zuhr" for this prayer time.  The timing of
                      Asr depends on the length of the shadow cast by a
                      vertical pole ("gnomon").  According to the Shafi
                      school of jurisprudence, Asr begins when the
                      length of the shadow of a vertical pole exceeds
                      the length of the pole.  According to the Hanafi
                      school of jurisprudence, Asr begins when the
                      length of the shadow exceeds twice the length of
                      the vertical pole.  In both cases, the minimum
                      length of the shadow at astronomical noon time of
                      the Sun is subtracted from the length of the
                      shadow before comparing it with the length of the
                      pole.

                      *note Islamic Asr-2 prayer time: x-Sun-asr-2, for
                      further details.
 
'2'     'o'           Calculates the approximate time when the center of
                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 0 degrees
                      on a "mathematical-geocentric" horizon in the
                      morning; thus rising.  A mathematical horizon is a
                      purely geometrically-built horizon which
                      disregards the phenomenon of refraction as it
                      arises in reality by the influence of the Earth's
                      atmosphere.  A geocentrical horizon is the
                      horizontal plane that passes through the Earth's
                      center, orthogonal to the observer's local
                      vertical.  In the further context, the shorter
                      term _mathematical horizon_ is used which actually
                      means the mathematical-geocentric horizon.
 
'2'     's'           Calculates the approximate time when the center of
                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 0 degrees
                      on a mathematical horizon in the evening; thus
                      setting.
 
'2'     'u'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is above a reference altitude of 0
                      degrees on a mathematical horizon; thus is
                      visible.
 
'2'     'z'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is below a reference altitude of 0
                      degrees on a mathematical horizon; thus is
                      non-visible.
 
'3'     'o'           Calculates the approximate time when the upper
                      limb of the Sun passes a reference altitude of 0
                      degrees on a mathematical horizon in the morning;
                      thus rising.  The above mentioned reference
                      altitude is computed from the value of the Sun's
                      semidiameter as it appear at that clocktime.  If
                      the reference altitude that is referring to the
                      Sun's upper limb is converted to a reference
                      altitude that is referring to the Sun's center,
                      this results in a value of about 16 arcminutes
                      below the geocentric horizon.
 
'3'     's'           Calculates the approximate time when the upper
                      limb of the Sun passes a reference altitude of 0
                      degrees on a mathematical horizon in the evening;
                      thus setting.  The above mentioned reference
                      altitude is computed from the value of the Sun's

                      visible.
 
'3'     'z'           Calculates the approximate period while the upper
                      limb of the Sun is below a reference altitude of 0
                      degrees on a mathematical horizon; thus is
                      non-visible.
 
'4'     'o'           Calculates the approximate time when the center of
                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 34
                      arcminutes below the geocentric horizon in the
                      morning; thus rising.  The phenomenon of
                      refraction is already respected in this as it
                      arises in reality by the influence of the Earth's
                      atmosphere, and that with the standard value of 34
                      arcminutes, which can indirectly be changed by
                      using the '--atmosphere' option.

                      how to change the base data of the atmosphere, so
                      that the atmospheric conditions as defined by it
                      are used to calculate the amount of refraction.

                      arcminutes below the geocentric horizon; thus is
                      visible.
 
'4'     'z'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is below a reference altitude of 34

                      arcminutes below the geocentric horizon in the
                      morning; thus rising.  This kind of rise time
                      calculation is done according to the standard
                      calculation method as it is commonly used
                      internationally.  The phenomenon of refraction is
                      already respected in this as it arises in reality
                      by the influence of the Earth's atmosphere, and

                      that the atmospheric conditions as defined by it
                      are used to calculate the amount of refraction.
                      The above mentioned reference altitude is computed
                      from the respective values of the Sun's
                      semidiameter and (standard) refraction as they
                      appear at that clocktime.  If the reference
                      altitude that is referring to the Sun's upper limb
                      is converted to a reference altitude that is
                      referring to the Sun's center, this results in a
                      value of about 50 arcminutes below the geocentric

                      refraction as they appear at that clocktime.
                      People of Islamic faith normally pray for the
                      second-last time on the day at this clocktime, or

                      is visible.  This kind of visibility period
                      calculation is done according to the standard

'6'     'o'           Calculates the approximate time when the center of
                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 6 degrees
                      below a mathematical horizon in the morning; thus
                      the beginning of "civil twilight".  The scattered
                      light of the Sun that is remaining at the
                      beginning of the civil twilight phase is in

                      below a mathematical horizon in the morning; thus
                      the beginning of "nautical twilight".  The
                      scattered light of the Sun that is remaining at
                      the beginning of the nautical twilight phase is in

                      of the Sun is above a reference altitude of 12
                      degrees below a mathematical horizon; thus the
                      period, while the center of the Sun is always
                      above -12 degrees.

                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 15 degrees
                      below a mathematical horizon in the morning; thus
                      the beginning of "amateur-astronomical twilight".
                      The scattered light of the Sun that is remaining
                      at the beginning of the amateur-astronomical
                      twilight phase is in general yet so faint that
                      most astronomical observations can be made.
 
'8'     's'           Calculates the approximate time when the center of
                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 15 degrees
                      below a mathematical horizon in the evening; thus

'8'     'z'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is below a reference altitude of 15
                      degrees below a mathematical horizon; thus the

                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 18 degrees
                      below a mathematical horizon in the morning; thus
                      the beginning of "astronomical twilight".  No
                      appreciable scattered sunlight is remaining at the
                      beginning of the astronomical twilight phase, the
                      sky is completely dark yet.  People of Islamic
                      faith normally pray for the first time on the day
                      during the period, which is between this clocktime
                      and the time of standard sunrise.  These people
                      commonly use the term "Fajr" for this prayer time.
                      *Note Standard rise time of the Sun: x-Sun-standard-rise,
                      for further details.

                      the Sun passes a reference altitude of 18 degrees
                      below a mathematical horizon in the evening; thus
                      the ending of astronomical twilight.  People of
                      Islamic faith normally pray for the last time on
                      the day at this clocktime, or some minutes later.
                      These people commonly use the term "Isha" for this
                      prayer time.
 
'9'     'u'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is above a reference altitude of 18
                      degrees below a mathematical horizon; thus the
                      period, while the center of the Sun is always

'9'     'z'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is below a reference altitude of 18
                      degrees below a mathematical horizon; thus the
                      period, while the center of the Sun is always
                      below -18 degrees.
 
'a'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate "topocentric", apparent
                      "elevation" of the Sun, thus the vertical angular
                      distance between the Sun's center and the horizon,
                      in degrees and arcminutes as it happen at civil
                      midnight time.  Results with a negative sign
                      signify that the Sun's center is below the horizon
                      at the moment, and results with a positive sign
                      mean that the momentary center of the Sun is above
                      the horizon.  Observations of celestial objects
                      that are done from the surface of the Earth yield
                      in topocentrically based data.  The locations of
                      the celestial bodies are often at another place if
                      the data is topocentrically determined instead of
                      determine it "geocentrically", i.e. at the
                      fictitious center of the Earth.  This is mainly
                      caused by the refraction, which raises a celestial
                      body to another location as it is been in reality.
                      Because the terrestrial globe flattens towards the
                      pole caps and therefore cannot be taken as an
                      ideally shaped sphere, the individual Earth radius
                      between the observer's location and the center of
                      the Earth also affects the computation of
                      topocentrically based data.

                      celestial equator, in degrees and arcminutes as it
                      happen at civil midnight time.  Results with a
                      negative sign signify that the Sun's center is
                      below the celestial equator at the moment, and
                      results with a positive sign mean that the
                      momentary center of the Sun is below the celestial
                      equator.
 
'd'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate topocentric, apparent

                      center and the vernal equinox point on the
                      "ecliptic" (the zodiacal line or Sun's orbit), in
                      degrees and arcminutes as it happen at civil

                      angular distance between the Sun's center and the
                      hour circle that passes through the vernal equinox
                      point on the ecliptic, as time value in hours and
                      minutes as it happen at civil midnight time.
 
'f'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate topocentric, apparent
                      distance of the Sun from the Earth in
                      "astronomical units" as it happen at civil
                      midnight time.  An astronomical unit, abbreviated
                      by ae, is equal to the mean distance of the Sun
                      from the Earth, which is about 149,597,870.691
                      kilometers.

                      arcminutes as it happen at civil midnight time.
                      The horizontal parallax of the Sun specifies the
                      diameter of the Earth as it is seen from the
                      surface of the Sun.

                      elevation of the Sun in degrees and arcminutes as
                      it happen at civil midnight time.  Results with a
                      negative sign signify that the Sun's center is
                      below the horizon at the moment, and results with
                      a positive sign mean that the momentary center of
                      the Sun is above the horizon.

                      declination of the Sun in degrees and arcminutes
                      as it happen at civil midnight time.  Results with
                      a negative sign signify that the Sun's center is
                      below the celestial equator at the moment, and
                      results with a positive sign mean that the
                      momentary center of the Sun is above the celestial
                      equator.

                      distance of the Sun from the Earth in astronomical
                      units as it happen at civil midnight time.
 
'p'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate geocentric, apparent
                      horizontal parallax of the Sun in degrees and
                      arcminutes as it happen at civil midnight time.
 
'q'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate geocentric, apparent
                      semidiameter of the Sun in degrees and arcminutes
                      as it happen at civil midnight time.
 
'r'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate "delta-t" in seconds as
                      it happen at civil midnight time.  Delta-t is the
                      difference between the Terrestrial Dynamical time
                      (abbreviated by TDT), that was formerly known as
                      _Ephemeris time_ (abbreviated by ET), and the
                      Universal time (UT).  Thus, 'delta-t == TDT - UT'.
 
's'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate, apparent location
                      oriented "sidereal time" (local sidereal time
                      (LAST), also known as _local star time_) in hours
                      and minutes as it happen at civil midnight time.
                      A "star day" is the period between two consecutive
                      upper culminations of the vernal equinox point on
                      the ecliptic in the meridian of the observer's
                      location.  Therefore, the local "star time" is the
                      momentary period, which is past between the last
                      upper culmination of the vernal equinox point in
                      the meridian of the observer's location (the
                      momentary hour angle of the vernal equinox point),
                      thus the right ascension of the stars in the
                      observer's meridian at the moment.
 
't'     'o', 's'      Outputs the base time as time value in hours and
                      minutes, for which the dynamical, i.e. depending
                      on the respective clocktime, astronomical data and
                      times of the Sun are calculated.  Without a given
                      '--time-offset=ARGUMENT' option, the astronomical
                      data and times of the Sun are always calculated
                      for 0 o'clock Universal time (UTC/GMT).
                      *Note Calendar option '--time-offset=ARGUMENT': x-time-offset,
                      for further details.
 
'u'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate Julian date in days as
                      it happen at civil midnight time.
                      *Note Julian day number::, for further information
                      about the Julian date.
 
'v'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate "Julian Ephemeris
                      date", thus a Julian date that is corrected by
                      _delta-t_, in days as it happen at civil midnight
                      time.
 
'w'     'o', 's'      Calculates the approximate difference between
                      "true solar time" and "mean solar time" as time
                      value in hours and minutes as it happen at civil
                      midnight time.  This so-called "equation of time"
                      is a correction to be added to the true solar time
                      --as read on a sundial-- to obtain the mean solar
                      time.  A "true solar day" is the period between
                      two consecutive lower culminations of the Sun.
                      This entity is taken as the base for deriving the
                      true solar time (as it is also shown by a sundial
                      during the day).  A star day is also known as a
                      'mean solar day'.  Because the Sun apparently
                      shifts with respect to the vernal equinox point on
                      the ecliptic due to the Earth's orbit around the
                      Sun, the star day and the true solar day have a
                      different length.  As the true Sun namely moves
                      irregularly through the ecliptic, a fictitious
                      "mean Sun" with a symmetrical motion through the
                      celestial equator is used for deriving the mean
                      solar time.  So, this difference in time is a
                      consequence of the ellipticity and tilt of the
                      Earth's orbit, causing the irregular apparent
                      movement of the Sun across the sky.
 
'x'     'o', 's'      Calculates the difference of the approximate
                      topocentric, apparent elevation of Sun and Moon
                      (delta), at which the Sun is used as the reference
                      point, in degrees and arcminutes as it happen at
                      civil midnight time.  Results with a negative sign
                      signify that the momentary center of the Sun is at
                      an elevation that is below the momentary elevation
                      of the Moon's center; thus the Sun is lower than
                      the Moon.  Results with a positive sign signify
                      that the momentary center of the Sun is at an
                      elevation that is above the momentary elevation of
                      the Moon's center; thus the Sun is higher than the
                      Moon.
 
'y'     'o', 's'      Calculates the difference of the approximate
                      topocentric, apparent azimuth of Sun and Moon
                      (delta), at which the Sun is used as the reference
                      point, in degrees and arcminutes as it happen at
                      civil midnight time.  The result specifies the
                      horizontal angular distance, by which the
                      momentary center of the Sun is distant from the
                      momentary Moon's center, and that measured at the
                      vertical circles that pass the Sun and the North

                      the length of the shadow cast by a vertical pole
                      is of single or shorter length than the pole
                      itself.
 
'Q'     'z'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is below a reference altitude, at which
                      a vertical pole either casts no shadow anymore, or
                      casts a shadow that is longer than the single
                      length of the pole itself.
 
'R'     'o'           Calculates the approximate time when the length of
                      the shadow cast by a vertical pole at forenoon is
                      *twice* the length of the pole.  Nevertheless, the
                      minimum length of the shadow is subtracted from
                      the length of the shadow before comparing it with
                      the length of the pole.

                      how to change the shadow length factor.
 
'R'     's'           Calculates the approximate time when the length of
                      the shadow cast by a vertical pole in the
                      afternoon is *twice* the length of the pole.
                      Nevertheless, the minimum length of the shadow is
                      subtracted from the length of the shadow before
                      comparing it with the length of the pole.  People
                      of Islamic faith, and that the people holding the
                      _Hanafi_ school of jurisprudence, normally pray
                      for the third time on the day at this clocktime,
                      or some minutes later.  These people commonly use
                      the term "Asr" for this prayer time.
                      *Note Astronomical noon time of the Sun: x-Sun-noon,
                      for more information.  And note
                      *note Fixed dates option '--adjust-value=ARGUMENT': x-adjust-value,
                      how to change the shadow length factor.
 
'R'     'u'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is above a reference altitude, at which
                      the length of the shadow cast by a vertical pole
                      is of double or shorter length than the pole
                      itself.
 
'R'     'z'           Calculates the approximate period while the center
                      of the Sun is below a reference altitude, at which
                      a vertical pole either casts no shadow anymore, or
                      casts a shadow that is longer than twice the
                      length of the pole itself.

  If no MODE is given, Gcal automatically uses that mode, which is
enabled by the mode character '5'.  If a mode character is given that is
not according to one of the '0'...'9', 'a'...'z' and 'A'...'R'
characters, Gcal also automatically uses that mode, which is enabled by
the mode character '5'.

  Gcal represents the Sun oriented special texts depending on the
selected mode using the following types and styles:

  1. Unsigned decimal based rational number value
     Unsigned decimal based rational number values are represented using
     the 'N.N...' format by default.  A '*' character that is directly
     given before some mode characters causes Gcal to represent the
     value for another quantity.  For the mode characters, which

       a. cause the calculation of Earth/Sun or Earth/Moon distances,
          the calculated distance is represented in kilometers.

       b. cause the calculation of phase angles of the Moon, the
          calculated phase angle is represented as a phase value in
          percents.

     If definite events happen, Gcal displays special event oriented
     texts instead of using the previously described representations.
     *Note Event texts of the Sun oriented special texts:
     x-Sun-event-texts, where you can find the event oriented texts that
     are created for clocktime values, which are schematically and
     analogously used for the type of representation as it is described
     here.

  2. Signed decimal based rational number value
     Signed decimal based rational number values are represented using
     the '+|-N.N...' format by default.  A '*' character that is
     directly given before a mode character causes Gcal not to represent
     such values using another style.

     If definite events happen, Gcal displays special event oriented
     texts instead of using the previously described representations.
     *Note Event texts of the Sun oriented special texts:
     x-Sun-event-texts, where you can find the event oriented texts that
     are created for clocktime values, which are schematically and
     analogously used for the type of representation as it is described
     here.

  3. Clocktime value
     Clocktime values are represented in hours and minutes, and that in
     the 'HH:MM' _24-hour_ format by default.  A '*' character that is
     directly given before a mode character causes Gcal to represent the
     clocktime value using the _12-hour_ format, thus to provide it with
     a time suffix.  *Note Actual local time '%t[ARGUMENT]' special
     text: x-Actual-local-time, for more details about the above
     mentioned time value template.

     If definite events happen, Gcal displays special event oriented
     texts instead of using the previously described representations:

        * In case Gcal is unable to compute the approximate clocktime by
          reason of a misspecified ARGUMENT, a '??:??' text will be
          created instead of the clocktime text.

        * In case Gcal calculates an approximate clocktime that refers
          to a previous or next day, or Gcal is unable to calculate a
          clocktime because the event calculated does not occur during
          this day, a '**:**' text will be created instead of the
          clocktime text.

        * In case Gcal is unable to calculate an approximate clocktime
          because the reference point of the astronomical object, thus
          either the center or the upper limb of the Sun's or the Moon's
          disk, is always above the respective reference altitude, a
          '++:++' text will be created instead of the clocktime text.

        * In case Gcal is unable to calculate an approximate clocktime
          because the reference point of the astronomical object, thus
          either the center or the upper limb of the Sun's or the Moon's
          disk, is always below the respective reference altitude, a
          '--:--' text will be created instead of the clocktime text.

  4. Unsigned time value
     Unsigned time values, which mostly denote a period or interval of
     time, are represented in hours and minutes using the 'HHhMM''
     format by default.  A '*' character that is directly given before a
     mode character causes Gcal to represent the time value using
     another style, and that in decimal hours, i.e. in the 'HH.H...'
     format.

     If definite events happen, Gcal displays special event oriented
     texts instead of using the previously described representations.
     *Note Event texts of the Sun oriented special texts:
     x-Sun-event-texts, where you can find the event oriented texts that
     are created for clocktime values, which are schematically and
     analogously used for the type of representation as it is described
     here.

  5. Signed time value
     Signed time values, which mostly denote a period or interval of
     time, are represented in hours and minutes using the '+|-HHhMM''
     format by default.  A '*' character that is directly given before a
     mode character causes Gcal to represent the time value using
     another style, and that in decimal hours, i.e. in the '+|-HH.H...'
     format.

     If definite events happen, Gcal displays special event oriented
     texts instead of using the previously described representations.
     *Note Event texts of the Sun oriented special texts:
     x-Sun-event-texts, where you can find the event oriented texts that
     are created for clocktime values, which are schematically and
     analogously used for the type of representation as it is described
     here.

  6. Unsigned angular value
     Unsigned angular values are represented in degrees and arcminutes
     using the 'DDDdMM'' format by default.  A '*' character that is
     directly given before a mode character causes Gcal to represent the
     angular value using another style, and that in decimal degrees,
     i.e. in the 'DDD.D...' format.

     If definite events happen, Gcal displays special event oriented
     texts instead of using the previously described representations.
     *Note Event texts of the Sun oriented special texts:
     x-Sun-event-texts, where you can find the event oriented texts that
     are created for clocktime values, which are schematically and
     analogously used for the type of representation as it is described
     here.

  7. Signed angular value
     Signed angular values are represented in degrees and arcminutes
     using the '+|-DDDdMM'' format by default.  A '*' character that is
     directly given before a mode character causes Gcal to represent the
     angular value using another style, and that in decimal degrees,
     i.e. in the '+|-DDD.D...' format.

     If definite events happen, Gcal displays special event oriented
     texts instead of using the previously described representations.
     *Note Event texts of the Sun oriented special texts:
     x-Sun-event-texts, where you can find the event oriented texts that
     are created for clocktime values, which are schematically and
     analogously used for the type of representation as it is described
     here.

  After the optional style and mode characters, the latitude and
longitude of the geographic co-ordinates follows, for which the
calculations must be made.  They must be conform the ISO-6709:1983
standard representation of latitude and longitude for geographic point
locations, so that the co-ordinate has to be declared like this:

   * Latitude ('+' for North and on the equator, '-' for South of the
     equator.)

     '+|-DD[.DD]'
          Degrees (2 digits), and optionally decimal degrees

     '+|-DDMM[.MM]'
          Degrees (2 digits), arcminutes (2 digits), and optionally
          decimal minutes

     '+|-DDMMSS[.SS]'
          Degrees (2 digits), arcminutes (2 digits), arcseconds (2
          digits), and optionally decimal seconds

   * Longitude ('+' for East and on the prime meridian (Greenwich), '-'
     for West of Greenwich and up to the 180th meridian.)

     '+|-DDD[.DD]'
          Degrees (3 digits), and optionally decimal degrees

     '+|-DDDMM[.MM]'
          Degrees (3 digits), arcminutes (2 digits), and optionally
          decimal minutes

     '+|-DDDMMSS[.SS]'
          Degrees (3 digits), arcminutes (2 digits), arcseconds (2
          digits), and optionally decimal seconds

   * Optionally, the relative height in meters above the sea level ('+'
     for heights above and on the sea level, '-' for heights below the
     sea level.)

     '[+|-N[N[N[N]]]]'
          Height in meters (integer number) in range '-9999'...'+9999'
          (1...4 digits)

  All components of the co-ordinates must have leadings zeroes in case
they have less digits than the templates shown above.  Declared decimal
seconds are not respected by Gcal.  Heights which have a negative sign
remain unrespected if Gcal determinates Sun and Moon data and times,
respectively.  In such a case, Gcal always uses the height '+0'.
Latitude and longitude co-ordinates, and the height of the observer's
location are connected without any separating characters, like
'+40-075+61', '+401213.1-0750015.1' or '+40.20361-075.00417+0061'.  See
the pertinent literature for more details.

  A time value '[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]', which is separated by a ','
character, may trail the co-ordinate.  Such a time value informs Gcal,
about how many minutes MMMM respectively hours HH and minutes MM the
geographic location is displaced from Universal time (UTC/GMT).  This
time displacement value defines the timezone, which is actually valid
for this location.  If summer- and wintertimes are respected for the
location, you should include that change in time into the timezone value
for the period in which the summertime is valid, by which the clock is
put on during the summertime period -- such a change is either
subtracted from the timezone value for locations West of the prime
meridian (Greenwich), or it is added for locations East of the prime
meridian, because Gcal is actually unable to perform such operations
automatically!  *Note Actual local time '%t[ARGUMENT]' special text:
x-Actual-local-time, for more details about the above mentioned time
value template.  If no time displacement value is specified for a given
co-ordinate, Gcal assumes a time displacement value of '0', which is
equal to the actual Universal time (UTC/GMT).

  The following table informs you about which type of representation is
caused by a mode.  The previously defined numbering scheme, as it has
been used for the introduction of the types of representations, is used
as key value in the column that holds the type of representation.  The
table also contains a column that shows whether a mode enables dynamical
values, i.e. values that are depending on the respective clocktime (if
you use the '--time-offset=ARGUMENT' option, you can change the
respective clocktime that is used for calculating such values).  In a
next table column, it is listed whether the given co-ordinate of the
location influences the determination of a value, and the last column of
the table gives you the information whether a given timezone value
affects the values determination:

  Here is a list that reports about the used reference systems in a
short manner, describes other aspects that are unmentioned now, and
informs about the lacks and limitations that are existing for the Sun
oriented special texts:

   * All astronomical calculations are based on methods that use
     --astronomically seen-- low-precision elements, which of course is
     shown in the precision of the results that are caused by them.
     Nevertheless in most cases, these results can be treated as more as
     sufficiently precise if one measures their practical use.

   * All azimuth and elevation values are always referring to the center
     of the respective astronomical object, except the case, it is
     stated otherwise.

   * The base point of azimuth values, right ascension values and other
     ecliptic co-ordinate values is always measured clockwise relative
     to the geographical, true North (not the magnetic North as shown by
     a compass), where angular values for the North direction are both
     denoted as 0 degree and 360 degree.

   * All topocentrically based azimuth and elevation values are always
     corrected by the amount of atmospheric refraction.  Such a kind of
     correction is always done if the center of the respective
     astronomical object is above 2 degrees below the horizon.

   * Generally, the rise and set times of the Sun cannot be precisely
     predicted, because depending on unpredictable atmospheric
     conditions, i.e. the local weather conditions as they appear during
     these times change the amount of atmospheric refraction at the
     horizon, so that the precalculated rise and set times may
     throughout be in error by a minute or more.

   * The accuracy of rise and set computations decreases again at high
     latitudes, i.e. within in the solar Arctic Circle.  There, small
     variations in atmospheric refraction can change the time of sunrise
     or sunset by many minutes, since the Sun intersects the horizon at
     a very shallow angle.  For the same reason, at high latitudes, the
     effects of observer height and local topography are magnified and
     can substantially change the times of the phenomena actually
     observed, or even whether the phenomena are observed to occur at
     all.

   * The short explanations that are given to the different twilight
     phases all assume the model of ideal atmospheric conditions by
     default.  It is obvious that these explanations all become
     meaningless if other conditions occur in reality, like a cloudy sky
     or a badly polluted atmosphere.

*Please also note the following references:*

   * *Note Fixed dates option '--precise': x-precise, how to obtain a
     more precise representation of the values which are cause by these
     special texts.

   * And note *note Calendar option '--time-offset=ARGUMENT':
     x-time-offset, how to change the clocktime, for which the
     dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective clocktime, Sun oriented
     special texts are calculated.

   * Likewise, see *note Fixed dates option '--cycle-end=ARGUMENT':
     x-cycle-end, how the dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective
     clocktime, Sun oriented special texts are calculated for a series
     of clocktimes for the current day.

   * And also note *note Fixed dates option '--adjust-value=ARGUMENT':
     x-adjust-value, how to change the reference altitude that is used
     to calculate the rise and set times, as well as the shadow length

     '--atmosphere=AIR-PRESSURE[,TEMPERATURE]': x-atmosphere, how to
     change the base data of the atmosphere that influences the
     calculation of the Sun oriented special texts.

   * And last, note *note Fixed dates option '--limit': x-limit, how to
     limit the rise and set times of the Sun to the actual day.

  All Sun oriented special texts *must* always be trailed by a
_whitespace_ character which is removed in output!

G.2.2.6 Moon data '%[FORMAT]?ARGUMENT' special texts
....................................................

'%[FORMAT]([*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate time of *moonrise* by default,
'%[FORMAT])[*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate time of *moonset* by default,
'%[FORMAT][[*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate period of *visibility* of the Moon (lunar day
length) by default,
'%[FORMAT]][*][MODE]ISO-6709:1983-CO-ORDINATE[,[+|-]MMMM|HH:[MM]]'
references the approximate period of *non-visibility* of the Moon (lunar
night length) by default.

  All these special texts can be used for at pleasure any geographic
point location, i.e. it is possible to determine different astronomical
values for any location on the globe, and that for at pleasure any
clocktime with a resolution of a single minute within the period of the
years AD 1 until AD 9999, that is respected by Gcal.

  The selection which value has to be calculated by these special texts
is done by specifying the MODE part of the preceding argument.
Actually, exactly 61 different modes can be used that are represented by
the '0'...'9', 'a'...'z' and 'A'...'Y' characters, and which create
different kind of results that are depending on the special text used.
First of all, here is a table in which all usable modes are described
and explained sufficiently.  You can also see from this table, which
Moon oriented special text or texts are corresponding to which mode,
i.e. cause the determination of an astronomical value as it is described
in the table:

'0'     '(', ')'      Calculates the approximate midnight time of the
                      Moon.  The astronomical midnight time of the Moon
                      is at that clocktime, when the Moon holds an
                      "azimuth" (horizontal angular distance between the
                      vertical circle, that passes the Moon, and the
                      North point) of either precisely 0 degrees of
                      precisely 180 degrees, which depends on the season
                      and the geographical location.  At that clocktime,
                      the Moon is close its "lowest culmination point",
                      i.e. close the lowest point below or above the
                      horizontal plane the Moon transits during this
                      day.  Nevertheless, there is exactly one day
                      during a "synodic month" (or lunation) --i.e. the
                      mean time between two consecutive "conjunctions"
                      (or New Moon phases)-- at which no lunar midnight
                      happens, because the Moon revolves the Earth
                      within 24 hours and 50 minutes on the average --
                      which also means, that the Moon rises on the
                      average 50 minutes later each day.
 
'1'     '(', ')'      Calculates the approximate noon time of the Moon.
                      The astronomical noon time of the Moon is at that
                      clocktime, when the Moon holds an azimuth of
                      either precisely 180 degrees of precisely 0
                      degrees, which depends on the season and the
                      geographical location.  At that clocktime, the
                      Moon is close its "highest culmination point",
                      i.e. close the highest point above or below the
                      horizontal plane the Moon transits during this
                      day.  Nevertheless, there is exactly one day
                      during a synodic month at which no lunar noon
                      happens.
 
'2'     '('           Calculates the approximate time when the center of
                      the Moon passes a reference altitude which is
                      between about 54 and 61 arcminutes above a
                      "mathematical-geocentric" horizon before lunar
                      noon time; thus rising.  A mathematical horizon is
                      a purely geometrically-built horizon which
                      disregards the phenomenon of refraction as it
                      arises in reality by the influence of the Earth's
                      atmosphere.  A geocentrical horizon is the
                      horizontal plane that passes through the Earth's
                      center, orthogonal to the observer's local
                      vertical.  In the further context, the shorter
                      term _mathematical horizon_ is used which actually
                      means the mathematical-geocentric horizon.  The
                      above mentioned reference altitude is computed
                      from the value of the Moon's parallax as it appear
                      at that clocktime.  Nevertheless, there is exactly
                      one day during a synodic month at which no such
                      moonrise happens.

                      that clocktime.  If the reference altitude that is
                      referring to the Moon's upper limb is converted to
                      a reference altitude that is referring to the

                      brighter than a star of 2m.  A negative magnitude

been used for the introduction of the types of representation, is used
as key value in the column that holds the type of representation.  The
table also contains a column that shows whether a mode enables dynamical
values, i.e. values that are depending on the respective clocktime (if
you use the '--time-offset=ARGUMENT' option, you can change the
respective clocktime that is used for calculating such values).  In a
next table column, it is listed whether the given co-ordinate of the
location influences the determination of a value, and the last column of
the table gives you the information whether a given timezone value
affects the values determination:

And now some examples to these special texts:

     The text 'Moonrise at %(+5158+00738,120  in MS, BRD' will be

     will be expanded to
     ==> 'Moonphase +16h00'=45.248% in MS, BRD', in case you call Gcal
     with the '--time-offset=16:' option and the actual system date is
     the 1st June 1998.

     The text 'Julian date at %(x+00+000 =%(y+00+000' will be expanded
     to

     with the '--time-offset=10:15' option and the actual system date is
     the 1st June 1998.

  Here is a list that reports about the used reference systems in a
short manner, describes other aspects that are unmentioned now, and
informs about the lacks and limitations that are existing for the Moon
oriented special texts:

   * All astronomical calculations are based on methods that use
     --astronomically seen-- low-precision elements, which of course is
     shown in the precision of the results that are caused by them.
     Nevertheless in most cases, these results can be treated as more as
     sufficiently precise if one measures their practical use.

   * All azimuth and elevation values are always referring to the center
     of the respective astronomical object, except the case, it is
     stated otherwise.

   * The base point of azimuth values, right ascension values and other
     ecliptic co-ordinate values is always measured clockwise relative
     to the geographical, true North (not the magnetic North as shown by
     a compass), where angular values for the North direction are both
     denoted as 0 degree and 360 degree.

   * All topocentrically based azimuth and elevation values are always
     corrected by the amount of atmospheric refraction.  Such a kind of
     correction is always done if the center of the respective
     astronomical object is above 2 degrees below the horizon.

   * Generally, the rise and set times of the Moon cannot be precisely
     predicted, because depending on unpredictable atmospheric
     conditions, i.e. the local weather conditions as they appear during
     these times change the amount of atmospheric refraction at the
     horizon, so that the precalculated rise and set times may
     throughout be in error by a minute or more.

   * The accuracy of rise and set computations decreases again at high
     latitudes, i.e. within in the lunar Arctic Circle.  There, small
     variations in atmospheric refraction can change the time of
     moonrise or moonset by many minutes, since the Moon intersects the
     horizon at a very shallow angle.  For the same reason, at high
     latitudes, the effects of observer height and local topography are
     magnified and can substantially change the times of the phenomena
     actually observed, or even whether the phenomena are observed to
     occur at all.

   * It is possible that calculations, which are done for locations
     within the lunar Arctic Circle, sometimes result in the wrongly
     **.** text instead of the more precisely ++:++ or -:- texts that
     are used for marking special events.  Unfortunately, therefore,
     then the reason why the Moon does not rise or set is no longer
     clearly evident, respectively, it is possible to get the false
     suggestion that the reason for non-rising or non-setting of the
     Moon is caused by just the one day within a synodic month, at which
     the Moon does not rise or set anyhow.  Unfortunately, it is just
     only obvious *that* the Moon does not rise or set during this day.

*Please also note the following references:*

   * *Note Fixed dates option '--precise': x-precise, how to obtain a
     more precise representation of the values which are cause by these
     special texts.

   * And note *note Calendar option '--time-offset=ARGUMENT':
     x-time-offset, how to change the clocktime, for which the
     dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective clocktime, Moon
     oriented special texts are calculated.

   * Likewise, see *note Fixed dates option '--cycle-end=ARGUMENT':
     x-cycle-end, how the dynamical, i.e. depending on the respective
     clocktime, Moon oriented special texts are calculated for a series
     of clocktimes for the current day.

   * Furthermore, see *note Fixed dates option
     '--adjust-value=ARGUMENT': x-adjust-value, how to change the
     reference altitude that is used to calculate the rise and set
     times.

   * And last, note *note Fixed dates option
     '--atmosphere=AIR-PRESSURE[,TEMPERATURE]': x-atmosphere, how to
     change the base data of the atmosphere that affects the calculation
     of the Moon oriented special texts.

  All Moon oriented special texts *must* always be trailed by a
_whitespace_ character which is removed in output!

G.2.2.7 Environment variable '%[FORMAT]-[ARGUMENT]' special text
................................................................

'%[FORMAT]-[ARGUMENT]' references the contents of an *environment
variable*, e.g.:

     The text 'I am `%-USER '-user' will be expanded to
     ==> 'I am `guest'-user', in case you logged-in as guest on your
     system.

  This special text *must* always be trailed by a _whitespace_ character
which is removed in output!

G.2.3 Replacements without any argument '%?' special texts
----------------------------------------------------------

Apart from further useful difference values, the text of a fixed date
can be provided with different texts used for highlighting.

G.2.3.1 Difference value '%[FORMAT]?' special texts
...................................................

The use of the other difference values as listed here is to calculate
distance values between two dates.  In case these special texts are
directly lead by a '-' character, e.g. '-%d', Gcal switches the sign of
the computed value.

  You may depreciate the special meaning of the '-' character --in case
this character itself is needed-- by placing a '\' (backslash) character
before it, e.g. '\-'.  If you need the '\-' characters themselves, you
have to protect the '\' (backslash) character by another '\' (backslash)
character, e.g. '\\-'.

  The following other difference values '%[FORMAT]?' special texts are
respected:

'%d'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *day* relative to the
     actual system date (==today), e.g.:

          The resource file line '0 %d days gone' will be expanded to
          ==> '-10 days gone', in case you call Gcal with the '-c10-'
          option and no command.

'%w'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *week* relative to the
     actual system date (==today).  Started weeks are counted as
     complete weeks.

'%m'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *month* relative to the
     actual system date (==today).  Started months are counted as
     complete months.

'%y'
     Specifies the current respectively queried *year* relative to the
     actual system date (==today).  Started years are counted as
     complete years.  This special text *must* always be trailed by a
     _whitespace_ character which is removed in output!

  An example:

  Supposing, the actual system date is the 4th September 1999.  To
calculate, how many days, weeks, months and years are between the actual
system date and the birthday of a person, who is born on 21st September
1962, Gcal can be called as follows:

     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'19620921 %y %m %w %d~' 1962
     -|
     -| -37 -444 -1928 -13497
     -|
     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'19620921 \\-%y \-%m %w -%d~' 1962
     -|
     -| \--37 --444 -1928 13497
     -|
     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'00000904 %y %m %w %d~' %19620921 1999
     -|
     -| 37 444 1928 13497
     -|
     $ gcal -f/dev/null -Ux -u -#'00000904 %y %B19620921' %19620921 1962
     -|
     -| 37 36

Please do not confound the relative year number '%[FORMAT]y' special
text with the age value '%B' special text (*note Age value
'%[FORMAT]B[DATE]' special text: x-Age-value.).  The '%y' special text
counts started years as complete years, while the '%B' special text does
not.

G.2.3.2 Highlighting '%?' special texts
.......................................

The following highlighting '%?' special texts are respected:

'%1'
     '%1' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day (*note Global option '--highlighting=TEXT':
     x-highlighting.).  This attains, that all succeeding text of the
     line after this special text is displayed in the same way as the
     highlighted respectively marked actual day.  '%1' is used together
     with the '%2' special text, which turns off this enabled
     highlighting sequence respectively produces the ending marking
     character.  If a '%1' text is not succeeded by a '%2' text on the
     line, Gcal automatically inserts such a '%2' text at the end of the
     line.

     For example:

          Only %1THIS%2 word is highlighted in this line.
          %1This text is highlighted up to%2 here.
          All from %1here up to the end of the line is highlighted.

'%2'
     '%2' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day.  This attains, that a possibly active highlighting
     according to the actual day is turned off respectively an ending
     marking character is produced.  '%2' is used together with the '%1'
     special text.  The '%2' text has no affect if no preceding '%1'
     text was found on the line.

'%3'
     '%3' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday, (*note Global option '--highlighting=TEXT':
     x-highlighting.).  This attains, that all succeeding text of the
     line after this special text is displayed in the same way as the
     highlighted respectively marked holiday.  '%3' is used together
     with the '%4' special text, which turns off this enabled
     highlighting sequence respectively produces the ending marking
     character.  If a '%3' text is not succeeded by a '%4' text on the
     line, Gcal automatically inserts such a '%4' text at the end of the
     line.

     For example:

          Only %3THIS%4 word is highlighted in this line.
          %3This text is highlighted up to%4 here.
          All from %3here up to the end of the line is highlighted.

'%4'
     '%4' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday.  This attains, that a possibly active highlighting
     according to a holiday is turned off respectively an ending marking
     character is produced.  '%4' is used together with the '%3' special
     text.  The '%4' text has no affect if no preceding '%3' text was
     found on the line.

'%5'
     '%5' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day if a fixed date is on today's date, (*note Global option
     '--highlighting=TEXT': x-highlighting.).  This attains, that all
     succeeding text of the line after this special text is displayed in
     the same way as the highlighted respectively marked actual day.
     '%5' is used together with the '%6' special text, which turns off
     this enabled highlighting sequence respectively produces the ending
     marking character.  If a '%5' text is not succeeded by a '%6' text
     on the line, Gcal automatically inserts such a '%6' text at the end
     of the line.

'%6'
     '%6' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day if a fixed date is on today's date.  This attains, that
     a possibly active highlighting according to the actual day is
     turned off respectively an ending marking character is produced.
     '%6' is used together with the '%5' special text.  The '%6' text
     has no affect if no preceding '%5' text was found on the line.

'%7'
     '%7' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday if a fixed date is on a legal holiday date, (*note Global
     option '--highlighting=TEXT': x-highlighting.).  This attains, that
     all succeeding text of the line after this special text is
     displayed in the same way as the highlighted respectively marked
     holiday.  '%7' is used together with the '%8' special text, which
     turns off this enabled highlighting sequence respectively produces
     the ending marking character.  If a '%7' text is not succeeded by a
     '%8' text on the line, Gcal automatically inserts such a '%8' text
     at the end of the line.

'%8'
     '%8' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting a
     holiday if a fixed date is on a legal holiday date.  This attains,
     that a possibly active highlighting according to a holiday is
     turned off respectively an ending marking character is produced.
     '%8' is used together with the '%7' special text.  The '%8' text
     has no affect if no preceding '%7' text was found on the line.

'%9'
     '%9' is replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively
     the starting marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day if a fixed date is on today's date; otherwise '%9' is
     replaced by the starting highlighting sequence respectively the
     starting marking character that is used for highlighting a holiday
     if a fixed date is on a legal holiday date, (*note Global option
     '--highlighting=TEXT': x-highlighting.).  This attains, that all
     succeeding text of the line after this special text is displayed in
     the same way as the highlighted respectively marked actual day or
     holiday.  '%9' is used together with the '%0' special text, which
     turns off this enabled highlighting sequence respectively produces
     the ending marking character.  If a '%9' text is not succeeded by a
     '%0' text on the line, Gcal automatically inserts such a '%0' text
     at the end of the line.

'%0'
     '%0' is replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively
     the ending marking character that is used for highlighting the
     actual day if a fixed date is on today's date; otherwise '%0' is
     replaced by the ending highlighting sequence respectively the
     ending marking character that is used for highlighting a holiday if
     a fixed date is on a legal holiday date.  This attains, that a
     possibly active highlighting according to today's date or a holiday
     is turned off respectively an ending marking character is produced.
     '%0' is used together with the '%9' special text.  The '%0' text
     has no affect if no preceding '%9' text was found on the line.

G.3 Shell command '%![ARGUMENT]' special text
=============================================

The ARGUMENT which trails '%!' until the end of the line, is passed to
the shell as a command for further processing.  But before, all text
variable references and '%?'... special texts for replacing particular
texts which are given in ARGUMENT are interpreted by Gcal.  *Note Text
variables::, and *note '%?'... special texts for text replacement:
Replacements..  All leading text before the '%!' special text is
processed by Gcal as usual.  If the simple '--debug' respectively
'--debug=internal' option is given at program start-up, informational
messages about the executed command and its _exit code_ will be shown on
the _standard error channel_ (*note Global option '--debug=internal':
x-debug-internal.).

  If the '--debug=abort' option is given, the Gcal program will be
aborted with an error code in case an _exit code_ not equal zero has
occurred during the execution of the command.  *Note Error Code 2:
x-2-Error-code, and *note Global option '--debug=abort': x-debug-abort,
for further information.

  Use the '--execute-command' option if you want to execute all
'%![ARGUMENT]' special texts by the shell instead of seeing them
textually only.  *Note Fixed date option '--execute-command':
x-execute-command, for more details.

Appendix H Summary of all '%?'... Special Texts
***********************************************

Here is a short-list of all '%?'... special texts which can be used in
the text part of Gcal resource file line.  Of course, not all
possibilities concerning the representation --which are offered by the
format instruction-- are listed here for those special texts which
expanded representation may be modified by an optional FORMAT, but only
some few exemplary.  *Note Format Instruction::, for further details.

Appendix I Obsolete Special Texts and Format Elements
*****************************************************

Because Gcal 4.1 is able to represent most special texts which may occur
in the text part of a resource file line (*note Description of all
'%?'... Special Texts: Special Texts.), and most of the format elements
as they may be used in the date format text of the '--date-format' *Note
Calendar option '--date-format=de|us|gb|TEXT': x-date-format, by using a
format instruction, some of them --mainly introduced in the Gcal
versions 2.20 and 2.40-- are obsolete now.  The following complete
tables of all these obsolete special texts respectively format elements
with their new representation, as used by Gcal 4.1 now, show the changes
made.

I.3 Table of Obsolete Date Formats
==================================

This table opposes all obsolete date format texts as they may be used in
the fixed defaults of the country specific date formats of the
'--date-format' option for German users, U.S. american users and users
in Great Britain (*note Calendar option '--date-format=de|us|gb|TEXT':
x-date-format.), and their new representation, as used by Gcal 4.1 now:

*CC*    *Old-style*                *New-style*
 
DE      '%w, %1%D%2 %b %y'     ==  '%<2#K, %1%>2*D%2 %<3#U %>04*Y'
US      '%W, %b %1%U%2 %y'     ==  '%<3#K, %<3#U %1%>2&*D%2 %>04*Y'
GB      '%W, %1%U%2 %b %y'     ==  '%<3#K, %1%>2&*D%2 %<3#U %>04*Y'

Appendix J Format Instruction
*****************************

Gcal 4.1 is able to represent text variables, special texts and date
formats especially in a very comfortable and uniform manner by using a
format instruction.

  Here comes the description of the format instruction components, now
called FORMAT in the further context.  In general, the template of a
format instruction is:

     ALIGNMENT [SIGN] [ZERO] WIDTH [STYLE] [SUFFIX] FORMAT

  If a FORMAT of above mentioned template is used, its components must
be specified in the above mentioned order, at which the definition of
the components embraced by '[ ]' is of course optional.  The single
components of the format instruction are assembled as follows:

*Character* *Description of the components*
 
            ALIGNMENT group (exactly one member must be defined):
'<'         Field contents is placed at the left margin of the field by
            using the width WIDTH
':'         Field contents is placed in centered manner in the field by
            using the width WIDTH
'>'         Field contents is placed at the right margin of the field
            by using the width WIDTH
 
            SIGN (may be defined):
'+'         Numerical value is provided with leading sign
 
            ZERO (may be defined):
'0'         Numerical value is filled with leading zero(es)
 
            WIDTH (must be defined):
N           Field has the width N (actual range 1...256).
 
            STYLE group (exactly one member may be defined):
'u'         Field contents is converted to upper-case letters
'l'         Field contents is converted to lower-case letters
'w'         Field contents is converted to capitalized words
 
            SUFFIX (may be defined):
'&'         Numerical value is provided with an Ordinal Number suffix
 
            FORMAT group (exactly one member must be defined):
'*'         Field contents is not cut after position WIDTH
'#'         Field contents is cut after position WIDTH

  If a given WIDTH component is greater 256 but less than 999, a field
width of 256 is assumed.  But if a given WIDTH component is zero, this
interrupts the interpretation phase of Gcal so that the complete FORMAT
is not interpreted anymore and is therefore displayed respectively
assigned as is.  The same happens if a component is misspelled, given in
wrong order, or one of the required components is unspecified.

  Furthermore, a STYLE component may be specified case-independently.
*Note Calendar option '--translate-string=TEXT': x-translate-string, for
further annotations how the STYLE component is used correctly.

Appendix K Coding Scheme
************************

The following coding scheme tables explain the relations between the
_date part_ (YYYY...) of a resource file line and the modifiers, the
short-style option '-c|C[]' --which is used for enabling the fixed date
feature-- respectively the '--period-of-fixed-dates=ARGUMENT' long-style
option may have, i.e. they point out all possible correspondences.  This
is necessary because Gcal does not respect all entries found in a
resource file if a _fixed date_ argument is given, it respects only
those entries which have a definite relation to the _fixed date_
argument to avoid the output of redundant information!  *Note Fixed
dates option '--period-of-fixed-dates=ARGUMENT':
x-period-of-fixed-dates, for further details.

In the _date part_ YYYY...:

YYYY
     represents any year number ('0001...9999').

MM
     represents any month number ('01...12' or '99') respectively any
     textual short month name with length of 3 characters ('Jan',
     'Feb'...).

DD
     represents any day number ('01...28', '29', '30', '31' or '99').

WWW
     represents any textual short weekday name with length of 2...3
     characters ('Mon...Sun').

?
     represents any case-insensitive single letter.

N
     represents any positive integer number (one or more digits).

     Sets the number of columns on the screen.  Takes precedence over
     the number of columns specified by the 'TERM' environment variable
     or the system itself.

'GCAL_DATE_FORMAT'
     Contains the date format text which defines the ordering of a
     displayed date.  Takes precedence over the default date format
     text.

'GCAL_LINES'
'LINES'
     Sets the number of lines on the screen.  Takes precedence over the
     number of lines specified by the 'TERM' environment variable or the
     system itself.

'GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'
     Name of a file directory absolute to the _root_/$PREFIX file
     directory, where the system-administrator stores common, _public
     access_ resource files (dates files).

'GCAL_USR_DATADIR'
     Name of a file directory relative to the 'HOME' file directory,
     where the user stores personal, respectively _private access_
     resource files (dates files).  Takes precedence over
     'GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'.

'GCALANSI'
     If defined or set, ANSI escape highlighting sequences are used
     respectively substituted by default if no other highlighting
     sequences are defined by command line option or found in the
     Termcap library.

'GCALPATH'
     (':') colon-separated list of file directories which are searched
     to find the '.gcalrc' file.  Takes precedence over 'HOME',
     'GCAL_USR_DATADIR' and 'GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'.

'GCALPROG'
     Contains the file name of the executable Gcal program that is used
     by the Tcal program to call the Gcal program.  Takes precedence
     over the file name 'gcal' which is burned-in during the compilation
     step of the Tcal program.  The 'GCALPROG' environment variable must
     always be set if the Gcal program is installed under another name
     than the standard name 'gcal', otherwise Tcal is unable to execute
     the Gcal program automatically!

'HOME'
     Name of the user's home file directory.  This is used to find the
     '.gcalrc' file.  Takes precedence over 'GCAL_USR_DATADIR' and
     'GCAL_SYS_DATADIR'.

'LANGUAGE'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.  Takes precedence over 'LC_ALL', 'LC_MESSAGES'
     and 'LANG'.

'LC_ALL'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.  Takes precedence over 'LC_MESSAGES' and
     'LANG'.

'LC_MESSAGES'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.  Takes precedence over 'LANG'.

'LANG'
     The national language and other cultural-specific conventions used
     by Gcal at run-time.

'LOGNAME'
     The eMail address which is used if the mailing option is wanted.
     *Note Global option '--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail, for more details.

'MAILPROG'
     Name of the mailer program which is used if the mailing option is
     wanted.  Takes precedence over the file name 'mail' which is
     burned-in during the compilation step of the Gcal program.  *Note
     Global option '--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail, for more details.

'MAILTO'
     The eMail address which is used if the mailing option is wanted.
     Takes precedence over 'USER' and 'LOGNAME'.  *Note Global option
     '--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail, for more details.

'PAGER'
     Name of the _external pager_ program which is used if the paging
     option is wanted.  *Note Global option '--pager': x-pager, for more
     details.

'PATH'
     (':') colon-separated list of file directories which are searched
     to find the _external pager_ program.  *Note Global option
     '--pager': x-pager, for more details.

'TERM'
     The type of terminal on which the Gcal program is being run.

'TXT2GCALPROG'
     Contains the file name of the executable Txt2gcal program that is
     used by the Gcal program to call the Txt2gcal program.  Takes
     precedence over the file name 'txt2gcal' which is burned-in during
     the compilation step of the Gcal program.  The 'TXT2GCALPROG'
     environment variable must always be set if the Txt2gcal program is
     installed under another name than the standard name 'txt2gcal',
     otherwise Gcal is unable to execute the Txt2gcal program
     automatically!  *Note Text variables::, for further details.

'TZ'
     The timezone information which is added to the date text of sent
     eMails, created response files and created shell script files.

'USER'
     The eMail address which is used if the mailing option is wanted.
     Takes precedence over 'LOGNAME'.  *Note Global option
     '--mail[=ADDRESS]': x-mail, for more details.

     value (Latin term 'magnitudo', abbreviated m).  The difference
     between two consecutive magnitudes is 1 to 2.512.  Therefore, a
     star with the brightness of 1m is 2.512 times brighter than a star

"True solar time"
"True solar day"
     A true solar day is the period between two consecutive lower

     deriving the true solar time (as it is also shown by a sundial
     during the day).

"True track"
"Course angle"
     The course angle gives the direction, which is the vertex of a
     great circles arc (Orthodrome) that is casted between two points on

     ellipsoid) that is calculated taking pattern from the 'World
     Geodetic System', short W.G.S, that was designed in 1961).  Such an
     arc is the shortest geodetic connecting line between two points on
     a sphere.  Indeed, the course angles on such an arc are changing
     continually, because the circular line that is casted intersects
     each meridian with another angle -- except the case, that both
     co-ordinates are referring to exactly the same longitude or to
     exactly the same latitude.

"Twilight"

Appendix O GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013
     Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
