GNU Gnulib
**********

   This manual is for GNU Gnulib (updated 2020-12-07 17:58:53), which is
a library of common routines intended to be shared at the source level.

1 Brief Overview
****************

   Gnulib is a source code library that provides basic functionality to
programs and libraries.  Many software packages make use of Gnulib to
avoid reinventing the portability wheel.

   Resources:

   * Gnulib is hosted at Savannah:
     <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib>.  Get the sources
     through Git from there.
   * The Gnulib home page: <https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/>.

1.1 Gnulib Basics
=================

   While portability across operating systems is not one of GNU's
primary goals, it has helped introduce many people to the GNU system,
and is worthwhile when it can be achieved at a low cost.  This
collection helps lower that cost.

   Gnulib is intended to be the canonical source for most of the
important "portability" and/or common files for GNU projects.  These are
files intended to be shared at the source level; Gnulib is not a typical
library meant to be installed and linked against.  Thus, unlike most
projects, Gnulib does not normally generate a source tarball
distribution; instead, developers grab modules directly from the source
repository.

   The easiest, and recommended, way to do this is to use the
'gnulib-tool' script.  Since there is no installation procedure for
Gnulib, 'gnulib-tool' needs to be run directly in the directory that
contains the Gnulib source code.  You can do this either by specifying
the absolute filename of 'gnulib-tool', or by using a symbolic link from
a place inside your 'PATH' to the 'gnulib-tool' file of your preferred
Gnulib checkout.  For example:

     $ ln -s $HOME/gnu/src/gnulib.git/gnulib-tool $HOME/bin/gnulib-tool

1.2 Git Checkout
================

   Gnulib is available for anonymous checkout.  In any Bourne-shell the
following should work:

     $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gnulib.git

   For a read-write checkout you need to have a login on
'savannah.gnu.org' and be a member of the Gnulib project at
<https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib>.  Then, instead of the URL
<git://git.sv.gnu.org/gnulib>, use the URL
'ssh://USER@git.sv.gnu.org/srv/git/gnulib' where USER is your login name
on savannah.gnu.org.

   git resources:

Overview:
     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>
Homepage:
     <https://git-scm.com/>

   When you use 'git annotate' or 'git blame' with Gnulib, it's
recommended that you use the '-w' option, in order to ignore massive
whitespace changes that happened in 2009.

1.3 Keeping Up-to-date
======================

   The best way to work with Gnulib is to check it out of git.  To
synchronize, you can use 'git pull'.

   Subscribing to the <bug-gnulib@gnu.org> mailing list will help you to
plan when to update your local copy of Gnulib (which you use to maintain
your software) from git.  You can review the archives, subscribe, etc.,
via <https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnulib>.

   Sometimes, using an updated version of Gnulib will require you to use
newer versions of GNU Automake or Autoconf.  You may find it helpful to
join the autotools-announce mailing list to be advised of such changes.

1.4 Contributing to Gnulib
==========================

   All software here is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation--you
need to have filled out an assignment form for a project that uses the
module for that contribution to be accepted here.

   If you have a piece of code that you would like to contribute, please
email <bug-gnulib@gnu.org>.

   Generally we are looking for files that fulfill at least one of the
following requirements:

   * If your '.c' and '.h' files define functions that are broken or
     missing on some other system, we should be able to include it.

   * If your functions remove arbitrary limits from existing functions
     (either under the same name, or as a slightly different name), we
     should be able to include it.

   If your functions define completely new but rarely used
functionality, you should probably consider packaging it as a separate
library.

1.4.1 Gnulib licensing
----------------------

   Gnulib contains code both under GPL and LGPL.  Because several
packages that use Gnulib are GPL, the files state they are licensed
under GPL.  However, to support LGPL projects as well, you may use some
of the files under LGPL.  The "License:" information in the files under
modules/ clarifies the real license that applies to the module source.

   Keep in mind that if you submit patches to files in Gnulib, you
should license them under a compatible license, which means that
sometimes the contribution will have to be LGPL, if the original file is
available under LGPL via a "License: LGPL" information in the projects'
modules/ file.

1.4.2 Indent with spaces not TABs
---------------------------------

   We use space-only indentation in nearly all files.  This includes all
'*.h', '*.c', '*.y' files, except for the 'regex' module.  Makefile and
ChangeLog files are excluded, since TAB characters are part of their
format.

   In order to tell your editor to produce space-only indentation, you
can use these instructions.

   * For Emacs: Add these lines to your Emacs initialization file
     ('$HOME/.emacs' or similar):

          ;; In Gnulib, indent with spaces everywhere (not TABs).
          ;; Exceptions: Makefile and ChangeLog modes.
          (add-hook 'find-file-hook '(lambda ()
            (if (and buffer-file-name
                     (string-match "/gnulib\\>" (buffer-file-name))
                     (not (string-equal mode-name "Change Log"))
                     (not (string-equal mode-name "Makefile")))
                (setq indent-tabs-mode nil))))

   * For vi (vim): Add these lines to your '$HOME/.vimrc' file:

          " Don't use tabs for indentation. Spaces are nicer to work with.
          set expandtab

     For Makefile and ChangeLog files, compensate for this by adding
     this to your '$HOME/.vim/after/indent/make.vim' file, and similarly
     for your '$HOME/.vim/after/indent/changelog.vim' file:

          " Use tabs for indentation, regardless of the global setting.
          set noexpandtab

   * For Eclipse: In the "Window|Preferences" dialog (or
     "Eclipse|Preferences" dialog on Mac OS),

       1. Under "General|Editors|Text Editors", select the "Insert
          spaces for tabs" checkbox.

       2. Under "C/C++|Code Style", select a code style profile that has
          the "Indentation|Tab policy" combobox set to "Spaces only",
          such as the "GNU [built-in]" policy.

     If you use the GNU indent program, pass it the option '--no-tabs'.

1.4.3 How to add a new module
-----------------------------

   * Add the header files and source files to 'lib/'.

   * If the module needs configure-time checks, write an Autoconf macro
     for it in 'm4/MODULE.m4'.  See 'm4/README' for details.

   * Write a module description 'modules/MODULE', based on
     'modules/TEMPLATE'.

   * If the module contributes a section to the end-user documentation,
     put this documentation in 'doc/MODULE.texi' and add it to the
     "Files" section of 'modules/MODULE'.  Most modules don't do this;
     they have only documentation for the programmer (= Gnulib user).
     Such documentation usually goes into the 'lib/' source files.  It
     may also go into 'doc/'; but don't add it to the module description
     in this case.

   * Add the module to the list in 'MODULES.html.sh'.

You can test that a module builds correctly with:

     $ ./gnulib-tool --create-testdir --dir=/tmp/testdir module1 ... moduleN
     $ cd /tmp/testdir
     $ ./configure && make

Other things:

   * Check the license and copyright year of headers.

   * Check that the source code follows the GNU coding standards; see
     <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards>.

   * Add source files to 'config/srclist*' if they are identical to
     upstream and should be upgraded in Gnulib whenever the upstream
     source changes.

   * Include header files in source files to verify the function
     prototypes.

   * Make sure a replacement function doesn't cause warnings or clashes
     on systems that have the function.

   * Autoconf functions can use 'gl_*' prefix.  The 'AC_*' prefix is for
     autoconf internal functions.

   * Build files only if they are needed on a platform.  Look at the
     'alloca' and 'fnmatch' modules for how to achieve this.  If for
     some reason you cannot do this, and you have a '.c' file that leads
     to an empty '.o' file on some platforms (through some big '#if'
     around all the code), then ensure that the compilation unit is not
     empty after preprocessing.  One way to do this is to '#include
     <stddef.h>' or '<stdio.h>' before the big '#if'.

1.5 Portability guidelines
==========================

   Gnulib code is intended to be portable to a wide variety of
platforms, not just GNU platforms.  Gnulib typically attempts to support
a platform as long as it is still supported by its provider, even if the
platform is not the latest version.  *Note Target Platforms::.

   Many Gnulib modules exist so that applications need not worry about
undesirable variability in implementations.  For example, an application
that uses the 'malloc' module need not worry about 'malloc (0)'
returning 'NULL' on some Standard C platforms; and 'glob' users need not
worry about 'glob' silently omitting symbolic links to nonexistent files
on some platforms that do not conform to POSIX.

   Gnulib code is intended to port without problem to new hosts, e.g.,
hosts conforming to recent C and POSIX standards.  Hence Gnulib code
should avoid using constructs that these newer standards no longer
require, without first testing for the presence of these constructs.
For example, because C11 made variable length arrays optional, Gnulib
code should avoid them unless it first uses the 'vararrays' module to
check whether they are supported.

   The following subsections discuss some exceptions and caveats to the
general Gnulib portability guidelines.

1.5.1 C language versions
-------------------------

   Currently Gnulib assumes at least a freestanding C99 compiler,
possibly operating with a C library that predates C99; with time this
assumption will likely be strengthened to later versions of the C
standard.  Old platforms currently supported include AIX 6.1, HP-UX 11i
v1 and Solaris 10, though these platforms are rarely tested.  Gnulib
itself is so old that it contains many fixes for obsolete platforms,
fixes that may be removed in the future.

   Because of the freestanding C99 assumption, Gnulib code can include
'<float.h>', '<limits.h>', '<stdarg.h>', '<stdbool.h>', '<stddef.h>',
and '<stdint.h>' unconditionally.  Gnulib code can also assume the
existence of '<ctype.h>', '<errno.h>', '<fcntl.h>', '<locale.h>',
'<signal.h>', '<stdio.h>', '<stdlib.h>', '<string.h>', and '<time.h>'.
Similarly, many modules include '<sys/types.h>' even though it's not
even in C11; that's OK since '<sys/types.h>' has been around nearly
forever.

   Even if the include files exist, they may not conform to the C
standard.  However, GCC has a 'fixincludes' script that attempts to fix
most C89-conformance problems.  Gnulib currently assumes include files
largely conform to C89 or better.  People still using ancient hosts
should use fixincludes or fix their include files manually.

   Even if the include files conform, the library itself may not.  For
example, 'strtod' and 'mktime' have some bugs on some platforms.  You
can work around some of these problems by requiring the relevant
modules, e.g., the Gnulib 'mktime' module supplies a working and
conforming 'mktime'.

1.5.2 C99 features assumed by Gnulib
------------------------------------

   Although the C99 standard specifies many features, Gnulib code is
conservative about using them, partly because Gnulib predates the
widespread adoption of C99, and partly because many C99 features are not
well-supported in practice.  C99 features that are reasonably portable
nowadays include:

   * A declarations after a statement, or as the first clause in a 'for'
     statement.

   * 'long long int'.

   * '<stdbool.h>', assuming the 'stdbool' module is used.  *Note
     stdbool.h::.

   * '<stdint.h>', assuming the 'stdint' module is used.  *Note
     stdint.h::.

   * Compound literals and designated initializers.

   * Variadic macros.

   * 'static inline' functions.

   * '__func__', assuming the 'func' module is used.  *Note func::.

   * The 'restrict' qualifier, assuming 'AC_REQUIRE([AC_C_RESTRICT])' is
     used.  This qualifier is sometimes implemented via a macro, so C++
     code that uses Gnulib should avoid using 'restrict' as an
     identifier.

   * Flexible array members (however, see the 'flexmember' module).

1.5.3 C99 features avoided by Gnulib
------------------------------------

   Gnulib avoids some features even though they are standardized by C99,
as they have portability problems in practice.  Here is a partial list
of avoided C99 features.  Many other C99 features are portable only if
their corresponding modules are used; Gnulib code that uses such a
feature should require the corresponding module.

   * Variable length arrays, unless '__STDC_NO_VLA__' is defined.  See
     the 'vararrays' module.

   * 'extern inline' functions, without checking whether they are
     supported.  *Note extern inline::.

   * Type-generic math functions.

   * Universal character names in source code.

   * '<iso646.h>', since GNU programs need not worry about deficient
     source-code encodings.

   * Comments beginning with '//'.  This is mostly for style reasons.

1.5.4 Other portability assumptions made by Gnulib
--------------------------------------------------

   The GNU coding standards allow one departure from strict C: Gnulib
code can assume that standard internal types like 'ptrdiff_t' and
'size_t' are no wider than 'long'.  POSIX requires implementations to
support at least one programming environment where this is true, and
such environments are recommended for Gnulib-using applications.  When
it is easy to port to non-POSIX platforms like MinGW where these types
are wider than 'long', new Gnulib code should do so, e.g., by using
'ptrdiff_t' instead of 'long'.  However, it is not always that easy, and
no effort has been made to check that all Gnulib modules work on
MinGW-like environments.

   Gnulib code makes the following additional assumptions:

   * 'int' and 'unsigned int' are at least 32 bits wide.  POSIX and the
     GNU coding standards both require this.

   * Signed integer arithmetic is two's complement.

     Previously, Gnulib code sometimes also assumed that signed integer
     arithmetic wraps around, but modern compiler optimizations
     sometimes do not guarantee this, and Gnulib code with this
     assumption is now considered to be questionable.  *Note Integer
     Properties::.

     Although some Gnulib modules contain explicit support for the other
     signed integer representations allowed by the C standard (ones'
     complement and signed magnitude), these modules are the exception
     rather than the rule.  All practical Gnulib targets use two's
     complement.

   * There are no "holes" in integer values: all the bits of an integer
     contribute to its value in the usual way.  In particular, an
     unsigned type and its signed counterpart have the same number of
     bits when you count the latter's sign bit.

   * Objects with all bits zero are treated as 0 or NULL.  For example,
     'memset (A, 0, sizeof A)' initializes an array 'A' of pointers to
     NULL.

   * The types 'intptr_t' and 'uintptr_t' exist, and pointers can be
     converted to and from these types without loss of information.

   * Addresses and sizes behave as if objects reside in a flat address
     space.  In particular:

        * If two nonoverlapping objects have sizes S and T represented
          as 'ptrdiff_t' or 'size_t' values, then 'S + T' cannot
          overflow.

        * A pointer P points within an object O if and only if '(char *)
          &O <= (char *) P && (char *) P < (char *) (&O + 1)'.

        * Arithmetic on a valid pointer is equivalent to the same
          arithmetic on the pointer converted to 'uintptr_t', except
          that offsets are multiplied by the size of the pointed-to
          objects.  For example, if 'P + I' is a valid expression
          involving a pointer P and an integer I, then '(uintptr_t) (P +
          I) == (uintptr_t) ((uintptr_t) P + I * sizeof *P)'.  Similar
          arithmetic can be done with 'intptr_t', although more care
          must be taken in case of integer overflow or negative
          integers.

        * A pointer 'P' has alignment 'A' if and only if '(uintptr_t) P
          % A' is zero, and similarly for 'intptr_t'.

        * If an existing object has size S, and if T is sufficiently
          small (e.g., 8 KiB), then 'S + T' cannot overflow.  Overflow
          in this case would mean that the rest of your program fits
          into T bytes, which can't happen in realistic
          flat-address-space hosts.

        * Adding zero to a null pointer does not change the pointer.
          For example, '0 + (char *) NULL == (char *) NULL'.

   Some system platforms violate these assumptions and are therefore not
Gnulib porting targets.  *Note Unsupported Platforms::.

1.6 High Quality
================

   We develop and maintain a testsuite for Gnulib.  The goal is to have
a 100% firm interface so that maintainers can feel free to update to the
code in git at _any_ time and know that their application will not
break.  This means that before any change can be committed to the
repository, a test suite program must be produced that exposes the bug
for regression testing.  All experimental work should be done on
branches to help promote this.

   When compiling and testing Gnulib and Gnulib-using programs, certain
compiler options can help improve reliability.  The 'manywarnings'
module enables several forms of static checking in GCC and related
compilers (*note manywarnings::).  For dynamic checking, you can run
'configure' with 'CFLAGS' options appropriate for your compiler.  For
example:

     ./configure \
      CFLAGS='-g3 -O2'\
     ' -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2'\
     ' -fsanitize=undefined'\
     ' -fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error'

Here:

   * '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2' enables extra security hardening checks in
     the GNU C library.
   * '-fsanitize=undefined' enables GCC's undefined behavior sanitizer
     ('ubsan'), and
   * '-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error' causes 'ubsan' to abort the
     program (through an "illegal instruction" signal).  This measure
     stops exploit attempts and also allows you to debug the issue.

   Without the '-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error' option,
'-fsanitize=undefined' causes messages to be printed, and execution
continues after an undefined behavior situation.  The message printing
causes GCC-like compilers to arrange for the program to dynamically link
to libraries it might not otherwise need.  With GCC, instead of
'-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error' you can use the '-static-libubsan'
option to arrange for two of the extra libraries ('libstdc++' and
'libubsan') to be linked statically rather than dynamically, though this
typically bloats the executable and the remaining extra libraries are
still linked dynamically.

2 Philosophy
************

   Gnulib's design and development philosophy is organized around
steady, collaborative, and open development of reusable modules that are
suitable for a reasonably wide variety of platforms.

2.1 Benefits of using Gnulib
============================

   Gnulib is useful to enhance various aspects of a package:

   * Portability: With Gnulib, a package maintainer can program against
     the POSIX and GNU libc APIs and nevertheless expect good
     portability to platforms that don't implement POSIX.

   * Maintainability: When a package uses modules from Gnulib instead of
     code written specifically for that package, the maintainer has less
     code to maintain.

   * Security: Gnulib provides functions that are immune against
     vulnerabilities that plague the uses of the corresponding
     commonplace functions.  For example, 'asprintf',
     'canonicalize_file_name' are not affected by buffer sizing problems
     that affect 'sprintf', 'realpath'.  'openat' does not have the race
     conditions that 'open' has.  Etc.

   * Reliability: Gnulib provides functions that combine a call to a
     system function with a check of the result.  Examples are 'xalloc',
     'xprintf', 'xstrtod', 'xgetcwd'.

   * Structure: Gnulib offers a way to structure code into modules,
     typically one include file, one source code file, and one autoconf
     macro for each functionality.  Modularity helps maintainability.

2.2 Library vs. Reusable Code
=============================

   Classical libraries are installed as binary object code.  Gnulib is
different: It is used as a source code library.  Each package that uses
Gnulib thus ships with part of the Gnulib source code.  The used portion
of Gnulib is tailored to the package: A build tool, called
'gnulib-tool', is provided that copies a tailored subset of Gnulib into
the package.

2.3 Portability and Application Code
====================================

   One of the goals of Gnulib is to make portable programming easy, on
the basis of the standards relevant for GNU (and Unix).  The objective
behind that is to avoid a fragmentation of the user community into
disjoint user communities according to the operating system, and instead
allow synergies between users on different operating systems.

   Another goal of Gnulib is to provide application code that can be
shared between several applications.  Some people wonder: "What?  glibc
doesn't have a function to copy a file?"  Indeed, the scope of a
system's libc is to implement the relevant standards (ISO C, POSIX) and
to provide access functions to the kernel's system calls, and little
more.

   There is no clear borderline between both areas.

   For example, Gnulib has a facility for generating the name of backup
files.  While this task is entirely at the application level--no
standard specifies an API for it--the nai"ve code has some portability
problems because on some platforms the length of file name components is
limited to 30 characters or so.  Gnulib handles that.

   Similarly, Gnulib has a facility for executing a command in a
subprocess.  It is at the same time a portability enhancement (it works
on GNU, Unix, and Windows, compared to the classical 'fork'/'exec' idiom
which is not portable to Windows), as well as an application aid: it
takes care of redirecting stdin and/or stdout if desired, and emits an
error message if the subprocess failed.

2.4 Target Platforms
====================

   Gnulib supports a number of platforms that we call the "reasonable
portability targets".  This class consists of widespread operating
systems, for three years after their last availability, or--for
proprietary operating systems--as long as the vendor provides commercial
support for it.  Already existing Gnulib code for older operating
systems is usually left in place for longer than these three years.  So
it comes that programs that use Gnulib run pretty well also on these
older operating systems.

   Some operating systems are not very widespread, but are Free Software
and are actively developed.  Such platforms are also supported by
Gnulib, if that OS's developers community keeps in touch with the Gnulib
developers, by providing bug reports, analyses, or patches.  For such
platforms, Gnulib supports only the versions of the last year or the
last few months, depending on the maturity of said OS project, the
number of its users, and how often these users upgrade.

   Niche operating systems are generally unsupported by Gnulib, unless
some of their developers or users contribute support to Gnulib.

   The degree of support Gnulib guarantees for a platform depends on the
amount of testing it gets from volunteers.  Platforms on which Gnulib is
frequently tested are the best supported.  Then come platforms with
occasional testing, then platforms which are rarely tested.  Usually, we
fix bugs when they are reported.  Except that some rarely tested
platforms are also low priority; bug fixes for these platforms can take
longer.

2.4.1 Supported Platforms
-------------------------

   As of 2020, the list of supported platforms is the following:

   * glibc systems.  With glibc 2.19 or newer, they are frequently
     tested.  About the kernels:
        * glibc on Linux is frequently tested.
        * glibc on kFreeBSD is rarely tested.
   * Mac OS X.  In versions 10.13, it's occasionally tested.  In version
     10.5, it's rarely tested.
   * FreeBSD 11.0 or newer is occasionally tested.
   * OpenBSD 6.1 or newer is occasionally tested.
   * NetBSD 7.0 or newer is occasionally tested.
   * AIX 7.1 is occasionally tested.
   * Solaris 10 and 11 are occasionally tested.  Solaris 9 is rarely
     tested and low priority.
   * Cygwin 2.9 is occasionally tested.  Cygwin 1.7.x is rarely tested.
   * mingw is occasionally tested.  But note that some modules are
     currently unsupported on mingw: 'mgetgroups', 'getugroups',
     'idcache', 'userspec', 'openpty', 'login_tty', 'forkpty',
     'pt_chown', 'grantpt', 'pty', 'savewd', 'mkancesdirs', 'mkdir-p',
     'euidaccess', 'faccessat'.  The versions of Windows that are
     supported are Windows XP and newer.  Only the latest version of
     mingw is tested; older versions are not supported.
   * GNU Hurd 0.7 is rarely tested.
   * Native Windows, with MSVC as compiler, is rarely tested and low
     priority.  The versions of MSVC that are supported are MSVC 14
     (Visual Studio 2015) or newer.
   * musl libc is rarely tested.
   * Minix 3.3.0 is rarely tested.
   * IRIX 6.5 is very rarely tested.
   * Haiku is no longer tested.
   * uClibc on Linux is no longer tested.
   * QNX is no longer tested.

2.4.2 Formerly Supported Platforms
----------------------------------

   The following platforms were supported in the past, but are no longer
supported:
   * glibc versions 2.1.x and older.
   * Mac OS X 10.4 and older.
   * AIX 4 and older.
   * HP-UX 11.31.
   * IRIX 6.4 and older.
   * OSF/1 5.1.
   * Solaris 8 and older.
   * Interix.
   * BeOS.

   Gnulib supports these operating systems only in an unvirtualized
environment.  When you run an OS inside a virtual machine, you have to
be aware that the virtual machine can bring in bugs of its own.  For
example, floating-point operations on Solaris can behave slightly
differently in QEMU than on real hardware.  And Haiku's 'bash' program
misbehaves in VirtualBox 3, whereas it behaves fine in VirtualBox 4.

   Similarly, running native Windows binaries on GNU/Linux under WINE is
rarely tested and low priority: WINE has a set of behaviours and bugs
that is slightly different from native Windows.

2.4.3 Unsupported Platforms
---------------------------

   Some platforms with C compilers are not supported by Gnulib because
the platforms violate Gnulib's C portability assumptions.  *Note Other
portability assumptions::.

   These assumptions are not required by the C or POSIX standards but
hold on almost all practical porting targets.  If you need to port
Gnulib code to a platform where these assumptions are not true, we would
appreciate hearing of any fixes.  We need fixes that do not increase
runtime overhead on standard hosts and that are relatively easy to
maintain.

   These platforms are listed below to illustrate problems that Gnulib
and Gnulib-using code would have if it were intended to be portable to
all practical POSIX or C platforms.

   * The IBM i's pointers are 128 bits wide and it lacks the two types
     'intptr_t' and 'uintptr_t', which are optional in the C and POSIX
     standards.  However, these two types are required for the XSI
     extension to POSIX, and many Gnulib modules use them.  To work
     around this compatibility problem, Gnulib-using applications can be
     run on the IBM i's PASE emulation environment.  The IBM i's
     architecture descends from the System/38 (1978).

   * The Unisys ClearPath Dorado's machine word is 36 bits.  Its signed
     integers use a ones'-complement representation.  On these machines,
     'CHAR_BIT == 9' and 'INT_MIN == -INT_MAX'.  By default 'UINT_MAX'
     is 2^{36} - 2, which does not conform to the C requirement that it
     be one less than a power of two.  Although compiler options can
     raise 'UINT_MAX' to be 2^{36} - 1, this can break system code that
     uses -0 as a flag value.  This platform's architecture descends
     from the UNIVAC 1107 (1962).

   * The Unisys ClearPath Libra's machine word is 48 bits.  Its
     'unsigned int' uses the low-order 40 bits of the word, and 'int'
     uses the low-order 41 bits of the word with a signed-magnitude
     representation.  On these machines, 'INT_MAX == UINT_MAX', 'INT_MIN
     == -INT_MAX', and 'sizeof (int) == 6'.  This platform's
     architecture descends from the Burroughs B5000 (1961).

   The following platforms are not supported by Gnulib.  The cost of
supporting them would exceed the benefit because they are rarely used,
or poorly documented, or have been supplanted by other platforms, or
diverge too much from POSIX, or some combination of these and other
factors.  Please don't bother sending us patches for them.

   * Windows 95/98/ME.
   * DJGPP and EMX (the 32-bit operating systems running in DOS).
   * MSDOS (the 16-bit operating system).
   * Windows Mobile, Symbian OS, iOS.

2.5 Modules
===========

   Gnulib is divided into modules.  Every module implements a single
facility.  Modules can depend on other modules.

   A module consists of a number of files and a module description.  The
files are copied by 'gnulib-tool' into the package that will use it,
usually verbatim, without changes.  Source code files (.h, .c files)
reside in the 'lib/' subdirectory.  Autoconf macro files reside in the
'm4/' subdirectory.  Build scripts reside in the 'build-aux/'
subdirectory.

   The module description contains the list of files; 'gnulib-tool'
copies these files.  It contains the module's dependencies;
'gnulib-tool' installs them as well.  It also contains the autoconf
macro invocation (usually a single line or nothing at all);
'gnulib-tool' ensures this is invoked from the package's 'configure.ac'
file.  And also a 'Makefile.am' snippet; 'gnulib-tool' collects these
into a 'Makefile.am' for the tailored Gnulib part.  The module
description and include file specification are for documentation
purposes; they are combined into 'MODULES.html'.

   The module system serves two purposes:

  1. It ensures consistency of the used autoconf macros and
     'Makefile.am' rules with the source code.  For example, source code
     which uses the 'getopt_long' function--this is a common way to
     implement parsing of command line options in a way that complies
     with the GNU standards--needs the source code ('lib/getopt.c' and
     others), the autoconf macro which detects whether the system's libc
     already has this function (in 'm4/getopt.m4'), and a few
     'Makefile.am' lines that create the substitute 'getopt.h' if not.
     These three pieces belong together.  They cannot be used without
     each other.  The module description and 'gnulib-tool' ensure that
     they are copied altogether into the destination package.

  2. It allows for scalability.  It is well-known since the inception of
     the MODULA-2 language around 1978 that dissection into modules with
     dependencies allows for building large sets of code in a
     maintainable way.  The maintainability comes from the facts that:

        * Every module has a single purpose; you don't worry about other
          parts of the program while creating, reading or modifying the
          code of a module.

        * The code you have to read in order to understand a module is
          limited to the source of the module and the .h files of the
          modules listed as dependencies.  It is for this reason also
          that we recommend to put the comments describing the functions
          exported by a module into its .h file.

     In other words, the module is the elementary unit of code in
     Gnulib, comparable to a class in object-oriented languages like
     Java or C#.

   The module system is the basis of 'gnulib-tool'.  When 'gnulib-tool'
copies a part of Gnulib into a package, it first compiles a module list,
starting with the requested modules and adding all the dependencies, and
then collects the files, 'configure.ac' snippets and 'Makefile.am'
snippets.

2.6 Various Kinds of Modules
============================

   There are modules of various kinds in Gnulib.  For a complete list of
the modules, see in 'MODULES.html'.

2.6.1 Support for ISO C or POSIX functions.
-------------------------------------------

   When a function is not implemented by a system, the Gnulib module
provides an implementation under the same name.  Examples are the
'snprintf' and 'readlink' modules.

   Similarly, when a function is not correctly implemented by a system,
Gnulib provides a replacement.  For functions, we use the pattern

     #if !HAVE_WORKING_FOO
     # define foo rpl_foo
     #endif

and implement the 'foo' function under the name 'rpl_foo'.  This
renaming is needed to avoid conflicts at compile time (in case the
system header files declare 'foo') and at link/run time (because the
code making use of 'foo' could end up residing in a shared library, and
the executable program using this library could be defining 'foo'
itself).

   For header files, such as 'stdbool.h' or 'stdint.h', we provide the
substitute only if the system doesn't provide a correct one.  The
template of this replacement is distributed in a slightly different
name, with '.in' inserted before the '.h' extension, so that on systems
which do provide a correct header file the system's one is used.

   The modules in this category are supported in C++ mode as well.  This
means, while the autoconfiguration uses the C compiler, the resulting
header files and function substitutes can be used with a matching C++
compiler as well.

2.6.2 Enhancements of ISO C or POSIX functions
----------------------------------------------

   These are sometimes POSIX functions with GNU extensions also found in
glibc--examples: 'getopt', 'fnmatch'--and often new APIs--for example,
for all functions that allocate memory in one way or the other, we have
variants which also include the error checking against the out-of-memory
condition.

2.6.3 Portable general use facilities
-------------------------------------

   Examples are a module for copying a file--the portability problems
relate to the copying of the file's modification time, access rights,
and extended attributes--or a module for extracting the tail component
of a file name--here the portability to native Windows requires a
different API than the classical POSIX 'basename' function.

2.6.4 Reusable application code
-------------------------------

   Examples are an error reporting function, a module that allows output
of numbers with K/M/G suffixes, or cryptographic facilities.

2.6.5 Object oriented classes
-----------------------------

   Examples are data structures like 'list', or abstract output stream
classes that work around the fact that an application cannot implement
an stdio 'FILE' with its logic.  Here, while staying in C, we use
implementation techniques like tables of function pointers, known from
the C++ language or from the Linux kernel.

2.6.6 Interfaces to external libraries
--------------------------------------

   Examples are the 'iconv' module, which interfaces to the 'iconv'
facility, regardless whether it is contained in libc or in an external
'libiconv'.  Or the 'readline' module, which interfaces to the GNU
readline library.

2.6.7 Build / maintenance infrastructure
----------------------------------------

   An example is the 'maintainer-makefile' module, which provides extra
Makefile tags for maintaining a package.

2.7 Collaborative Development
=============================

   Gnulib is maintained collaboratively.  The mailing list is
'<bug-gnulib at gnu dot org>'.  Be warned that some people on the list
may be very active at some times and unresponsive at other times.

   Every module has one or more maintainers.  While issues are discussed
collaboratively on the list, the maintainer of a module nevertheless has
a veto right regarding changes in his module.

   All patches should be posted to the list, regardless whether they are
proposed patches or whether they are committed immediately by the
maintainer of the particular module.  The purpose is not only to inform
the other users of the module, but mainly to allow peer review.  It is
not uncommon that several people contribute comments or spot bugs after
a patch was proposed.

   Conversely, if you are using Gnulib, and a patch is posted that
affects one of the modules that your package uses, you have an interest
in proofreading the patch.

2.8 Copyright
=============

   Most modules are under the GPL.  Some, mostly modules which can
reasonably be used in libraries, are under LGPL.  The source files
always say "GPL", but the real license specification is in the module
description file.  If the module description file says "GPL", it means
"GPLv3+" (GPLv3 or newer, at the licensee's choice); if it says "LGPL",
it means "LGPLv3+" (LGPLv3 or newer, at the licensee's choice).

   More precisely, the license specification in the module description
file applies to the files in 'lib/' and 'build-aux/'.  Different
licenses apply to files in special directories:

'modules/'
     Module description files are under this copyright:

          Copyright (C) 20XX-20YY Free Software Foundation, Inc.
          Copying and distribution of this file, with or without
          modification, in any medium, are permitted without royalty
          provided the copyright notice and this notice are preserved.

'm4/'
     Autoconf macro files are under this copyright:

          Copyright (C) 20XX-20YY Free Software Foundation, Inc.
          This file is free software; the Free Software Foundation gives
          unlimited permission to copy and/or distribute it, with or
          without modifications, as long as this notice is preserved.

'tests/'
     If a license statement is not present in a test module, the test
     files are under GPL.  Even if the corresponding source module is
     under LGPL, this is not a problem, since compiled tests are not
     installed by "make install".

'doc/'
     Documentation files are under this copyright:

          Copyright (C) 2004-20YY Free Software Foundation, Inc.
          Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
          document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation
          License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the
          Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
          Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy of the
          license is at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html>.

   If you want to use some Gnulib modules under LGPL, you can do so by
passing the option '--lgpl' to 'gnulib-tool'.  This will replace the GPL
header with an LGPL header while copying the source files to your
package.  Similarly, if you want some Gnulib modules under LGPLv2+
(Lesser GPL version 2.1 or newer), you can do so by passing the option
'--lgpl=2' to 'gnulib-tool'.

   Keep in mind that when you submit patches to files in Gnulib, you
should license them under a compatible license.  This means that
sometimes the contribution will have to be LGPL, if the original file is
available under LGPL.  You can find out about it by looking for a
"License: LGPL" information in the corresponding module description.

2.9 Steady Development
======================

   Gnulib modules are continually adapted, to match new practices, to be
consistent with newly added modules, or simply as a response to build
failure reports.

   If you are willing to report an occasional regression, we recommend
to use the newest version from git always, except in periods of major
changes.  Most Gnulib users do this.

2.10 Openness
=============

   Gnulib is open in the sense that we gladly accept contributions if
they are generally useful, well engineered, and if the contributors have
signed the obligatory papers with the FSF.

   The module system is open in the sense that a package using Gnulib
can
  1. locally patch or override files in Gnulib,
  2. locally add modules that are treated like Gnulib modules by
     'gnulib-tool'.

   This is achieved by the '--local-dir' option of 'gnulib-tool' (*note
Extending Gnulib::).

3 Invoking gnulib-tool
**********************

   The 'gnulib-tool' command is the recommended way to import Gnulib
modules.  It is possible to borrow Gnulib modules in a package without
using 'gnulib-tool', relying only on the meta-information stored in the
'modules/*' files, but with a growing number of modules this becomes
tedious.  'gnulib-tool' simplifies the management of source files,
'Makefile.am's and 'configure.ac' in packages incorporating Gnulib
modules.

   'gnulib-tool' is not installed in a standard directory that is
contained in the 'PATH' variable.  It needs to be run directly in the
directory that contains the Gnulib source code.  You can do this either
by specifying the absolute filename of 'gnulib-tool', or you can also
use a symbolic link from a place inside your 'PATH' to the 'gnulib-tool'
file of your preferred and most up-to-date Gnulib checkout, like this:
     $ ln -s $HOME/gnu/src/gnulib.git/gnulib-tool $HOME/bin/gnulib-tool

   Run 'gnulib-tool --help' for information.  To get familiar with
'gnulib-tool' without affecting your sources, you can also try some
commands with the option '--dry-run'; then 'gnulib-tool' will only
report which actions it would perform in a real run without changing
anything.

3.1 Finding modules
===================

   There are four ways of finding the names of Gnulib modules that you
can use in your package:

   * You have the complete module list, sorted according to categories,
     in <https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/MODULES.html>.

   * If you are looking for POSIX function replacements that you don't
     know about yet, follow the procedure described in section *note
     Finding POSIX substitutes::.

   * If you are looking for a particular POSIX header or function
     replacement, look in the chapters *note Header File Substitutes::
     and *note Function Substitutes::.  For headers and functions that
     are provided by Glibc but not standardized by POSIX, look in the
     chapters *note Glibc Header File Substitutes:: and *note Glibc
     Function Substitutes::.

   * If you have already found the source file in Gnulib and are looking
     for the module that contains this source file, you can use the
     command 'gnulib-tool --find FILENAME'.

3.2 Initial import
==================

   Gnulib assumes that your project uses Autoconf.  When using Gnulib,
you will need to have Autoconf among your build tools.

   Gnulib also assumes that your project's 'configure.ac' contains the
line
     AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])
   The 'config.h' file gets generated with platform dependent C macro
definitions, and the source files include it (see *note Source
changes::).

   Unless you use 'gnulib-tool''s '--gnu-make' option, Gnulib also
assumes that your project uses Automake at least in a subdirectory of
your project.  While the use of Automake in your project's top level
directory is an easy way to fulfil the Makefile conventions of the GNU
coding standards, Gnulib does not require it.

   Invoking 'gnulib-tool --import' will copy source files, create a
'Makefile.am' to build them, generate a file 'gnulib-comp.m4' with
Autoconf M4 macro declarations used by 'configure.ac', and generate a
file 'gnulib-cache.m4' containing the cached specification of how Gnulib
is used.

   Our example will be a library that uses Autoconf, Automake and
Libtool.  It calls 'strdup', and you wish to use gnulib to make the
package portable to C99 and C11 (which don't have 'strdup').

     ~/src/libfoo$ gnulib-tool --import strdup
     Module list with included dependencies:
       absolute-header
       extensions

       #include <string.h>

     Don't forget to
       - add "lib/Makefile" to AC_CONFIG_FILES in ./configure.ac,
       - mention "lib" in SUBDIRS in Makefile.am,
       - mention "-I m4" in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am,
       - invoke gl_EARLY in ./configure.ac, right after AC_PROG_CC,
       - invoke gl_INIT in ./configure.ac.
     ~/src/libfoo$

   By default, the source code is copied into 'lib/' and the M4 macros
in 'm4/'.  You can override these paths by using
'--source-base=DIRECTORY' and '--m4-base=DIRECTORY'.  Some modules also
provide other files necessary for building.  These files are copied into
the directory specified by 'AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR' in 'configure.ac' or by
the '--aux-dir=DIRECTORY' option.  If neither is specified, the current
directory is assumed.

   'gnulib-tool' can make symbolic links instead of copying the source
files.  The option to specify for this is '--symlink', or '-s' for
short.  This can be useful to save a few kilobytes of disk space.  But
it is likely to introduce bugs when 'gnulib' is updated; it is more
reliable to use 'gnulib-tool --update' (see below) to update to newer
versions of 'gnulib'.  Furthermore it requires extra effort to create
self-contained tarballs, and it may disturb some mechanism the
maintainer applies to the sources.  For these reasons, this option is
generally discouraged.

   'gnulib-tool' will overwrite any pre-existing files, in particular
'Makefile.am'.  It is also possible to separate the generated
'Makefile.am' content (for building the gnulib library) into a separate
file, say 'gnulib.mk', that can be included by your handwritten
'Makefile.am', but this is a more advanced use of 'gnulib-tool'.

   Consequently, it is a good idea to choose directories that are not
already used by your projects, to separate gnulib imported files from
your own files.  This approach is also useful if you want to avoid
conflicts between other tools (e.g., 'gettextize' that also copy M4
files into your package.  Simon Josefsson successfully uses a source
base of 'gl/', and a M4 base of 'gl/m4/', in several packages.

   After the '--import' option on the command line comes the list of
Gnulib modules that you want to incorporate in your package.  The names
of the modules coincide with the filenames in Gnulib's 'modules/'
directory.

   Some Gnulib modules depend on other Gnulib modules.  'gnulib-tool'
will automatically add the needed modules as well; you need not list
them explicitly.  'gnulib-tool' will also memorize which dependent
modules it has added, so that when someday a dependency is dropped, the
implicitly added module is dropped as well (unless you have explicitly
requested that module).

   If you want to cut a dependency, i.e., not add a module although one
of your requested modules depends on it, you may use the option
'--avoid=MODULE' to do so.  Multiple uses of this option are possible.
Of course, you will then need to implement the same interface as the
removed module.

   A few manual steps are required to finish the initial import.
'gnulib-tool' printed a summary of these steps.

   First, you must ensure Autoconf can find the macro definitions in
'gnulib-comp.m4'.  Use the 'ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS' specifier in your top-level
'Makefile.am' file, as in:

     ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4

   You are now ready to call the M4 macros in 'gnulib-comp.m4' from
'configure.ac'.  The macro 'gl_EARLY' must be called as soon as possible
after verifying that the C compiler is working.  Typically, this is
immediately after 'AC_PROG_CC', as in:

     ...
     AC_PROG_CC
     gl_EARLY
     ...

   If you are using 'AC_PROG_CC_STDC', the macro 'gl_EARLY' must be
called after it, like this:

     ...
     AC_PROG_CC
     AC_PROG_CC_STDC
     gl_EARLY
     ...

   The core part of the gnulib checks are done by the macro 'gl_INIT'.
Place it further down in the file, typically where you normally check
for header files or functions.  It must come after other checks which
may affect the compiler invocation, such as 'AC_MINIX'.  For example:

     ...
     # For gnulib.
     gl_INIT
     ...

   'gl_INIT' will in turn call the macros related with the gnulib
functions, be it specific gnulib macros, like 'gl_FUNC_ALLOCA' or
Autoconf or Automake macros like 'AC_FUNC_ALLOCA' or 'AM_FUNC_GETLINE'.
So there is no need to call those macros yourself when you use the
corresponding gnulib modules.

   You must also make sure that the gnulib library is built.  Add the
'Makefile' in the gnulib source base directory to 'AC_CONFIG_FILES', as
in:

     AC_CONFIG_FILES(... lib/Makefile ...)

   You must also make sure that 'make' will recurse into the gnulib
directory.  To achieve this, add the gnulib source base directory to a
'SUBDIRS' Makefile.am statement, as in:

     SUBDIRS = lib

   or if you, more likely, already have a few entries in 'SUBDIRS', you
can add something like:

     SUBDIRS += lib

   Finally, you have to add compiler and linker flags in the appropriate
source directories, so that you can make use of the gnulib library.
Since some modules ('getopt', for example) may copy files into the build
directory, 'top_builddir/lib' is needed as well as 'top_srcdir/lib'.
For example:

     ...
     AM_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_builddir)/lib -I$(top_srcdir)/lib
     ...
     LDADD = lib/libgnu.a
     ...

   Don't forget to '#include' the various header files.  In this
example, you would need to make sure that '#include <string.h>' is
evaluated when compiling all source code files, that want to make use of
'strdup'.

   In the usual case where Autoconf is creating a 'config.h' file, you
should include 'config.h' first, before any other include file.  That
way, for example, if 'config.h' defines 'restrict' to be the empty
string on a non-C99 host, or a macro like '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS' that
affects the layout of data structures, the definition is consistent for
all include files.  Also, on some platforms macros like
'_FILE_OFFSET_BITS' and '_GNU_SOURCE' may be ineffective, or may have
only a limited effect, if defined after the first system header file is
included.

   Finally, note that you cannot use 'AC_LIBOBJ' or 'AC_REPLACE_FUNCS'
in your 'configure.ac' and expect the resulting object files to be
automatically added to 'lib/libgnu.a'.  This is because your 'AC_LIBOBJ'
and 'AC_REPLACE_FUNCS' invocations from 'configure.ac' augment a
variable '@LIBOBJS@' (and/or '@LTLIBOBJS@' if using Libtool), whereas
'lib/libgnu.a' is built from the contents of a different variable,
usually '@gl_LIBOBJS@' (or '@gl_LTLIBOBJS@' if using Libtool).

3.3 Modified imports
====================

   You can at any moment decide to use Gnulib differently than the last
time.

   There are two ways to change how Gnulib is used.  Which one you'll
use, depends on where you keep track of options and module names that
you pass to 'gnulib-tool'.

   * If you store the options and module names in a file under your own
     control, such as 'autogen.sh', 'bootstrap', 'bootstrap.conf', or
     similar, simply invoke 'gnulib-tool' again, with modified options
     and more or fewer module names.

   * 'gnulib-tool' remembers which modules were used last time.  If you
     want to rely on 'gnulib-tool''s own memory of the last used options
     and module names, you can use the commands 'gnulib-tool
     --add-import' and 'gnulib-tool --remove-import'.

     So, if you only want to use more Gnulib modules, simply invoke
     'gnulib-tool --add-import NEW-MODULES'.  The list of modules that
     you pass after '--add-import' is _added_ to the previous list of
     modules.

     Similarly, if you want to use fewer Gnulib modules, simply invoke
     'gnulib-tool --remove-import UNNEEDED-MODULES'.  The list of
     modules that you pass after '--remove-import' is _removed_ from the
     previous list of modules.  Note that if a module is then still
     needed as dependency of other modules, it will be used
     nevertheless.  If you want to _really_ not use a module any more,
     regardless of whether other modules may need it, you need to use
     the '--avoid' option.

     For other changes, such as different choices of '--lib',
     '--source-base' or '--aux-dir', the normal way is to modify
     manually the file 'gnulib-cache.m4' in the M4 macros directory,
     then launch 'gnulib-tool --add-import'.

     The only change for which this doesn't work is a change of the
     '--m4-base' directory.  Because, when you pass a different value of
     '--m4-base', 'gnulib-tool' will not find the previous
     'gnulib-cache.m4' file any more.  A possible solution is to
     manually copy the 'gnulib-cache.m4' into the new M4 macro
     directory.

     In the 'gnulib-cache.m4' file, the macros have the following
     meaning:
     'gl_MODULES'
          The argument is a space separated list of the requested
          modules, not including dependencies.

     'gl_AVOID'
          The argument is a space separated list of modules that should
          not be used, even if they occur as dependencies.  Corresponds
          to the '--avoid' command line argument.

     'gl_SOURCE_BASE'
          The argument is the relative file name of the directory
          containing the gnulib source files (mostly *.c and *.h files).
          Corresponds to the '--source-base' command line argument.

     'gl_M4_BASE'
          The argument is the relative file name of the directory
          containing the gnulib M4 macros (*.m4 files).  Corresponds to
          the '--m4-base' command line argument.

     'gl_TESTS_BASE'
          The argument is the relative file name of the directory
          containing the gnulib unit test files.  Corresponds to the
          '--tests-base' command line argument.

     'gl_LIB'
          The argument is the name of the library to be created.
          Corresponds to the '--lib' command line argument.

     'gl_LGPL'
          The presence of this macro without arguments corresponds to
          the '--lgpl' command line argument.  The presence of this
          macro with an argument (whose value must be 2 or 3)
          corresponds to the '--lgpl=ARG' command line argument.

     'gl_LIBTOOL'
          The presence of this macro corresponds to the '--libtool'
          command line argument and to the absence of the '--no-libtool'
          command line argument.  It takes no arguments.

     'gl_MACRO_PREFIX'
          The argument is the prefix to use for macros in the
          'gnulib-comp.m4' file.  Corresponds to the '--macro-prefix'
          command line argument.

3.4 Simple update
=================

   When you want to update to a more recent version of Gnulib, without
changing the list of modules or other parameters, a simple call does it:

     $ gnulib-tool --add-import

This will create, update or remove files, as needed.

   Note: From time to time, changes are made in Gnulib that are not
backward compatible.  When updating to a more recent Gnulib, you should
consult Gnulib's 'NEWS' file to check whether the incompatible changes
affect your project.

3.5 Changing your sources for use with Gnulib
=============================================

   Gnulib contains some header file overrides.  This means that when
building on systems with deficient header files in '/usr/include/', it
may create files named 'string.h', 'stdlib.h', 'stdint.h' or similar in
the build directory.  In the other source directories of your package
you will usually pass '-I' options to the compiler, so that these Gnulib
substitutes are visible and take precedence over the files in
'/usr/include/'.

   These Gnulib substitute header files rely on '<config.h>' being
already included.  Furthermore '<config.h>' must be the first include in
every compilation unit.  This means that to _all your source files_ and
likely also to _all your tests source files_ you need to add an
'#include <config.h>' at the top.  Which source files are affected?
Exactly those whose compilation includes a '-I' option that refers to
the Gnulib library directory.

   This is annoying, but inevitable: On many systems, '<config.h>' is
used to set system dependent flags (such as '_GNU_SOURCE' on GNU
systems), and these flags have no effect after any system header file
has been included.

3.6 Changing your link commands for use with Gnulib
===================================================

   When you use Gnulib, you need to augment the set of libraries against
which your programs and libraries are linked.  This is done by
augmenting the Automake variable 'LDADD' (for all programs) or
'PROG_LDADD' (for a single program 'PROG') or 'LIBRARY_la_LIBADD' (for a
single library 'LIBRARY.la').

   What do you need to add to this Automake variable?
  1. The reference to the Gnulib library.  In the example of section
     *note Initial import::, this would be 'lib/libgnu.a' for source in
     the top-level directory, or '../lib/libgnu.a' for source in a
     sibling directory of 'lib/'.

  2. References to additional libraries, brought in by some of the
     Gnulib modules that you use (directly or indirectly).  The complete
     list of such libraries is printed when you invoke 'gnulib-tool'.
     Alternatively, you can retrieve the set of additional libraries
     required by a specific Gnulib module by running
          ./gnulib-tool --extract-recursive-link-directive MODULE
     Beware: By looking into the module description file
     'modules/MODULE' or by running
          ./gnulib-tool --extract-link-directive MODULE
     you would miss the link dependencies of indirectly used modules.

3.7 Finding recommended ISO C and POSIX function substitutes
============================================================

   Gnulib contains a wealth of portability workarounds for ISO C and
POSIX functions.  They are listed in detail in the chapter *note
Function Substitutes::.  If you want to know which function substitutes
are recommended for your package, you can search your source code for
ISO C and POSIX functions that it uses and read the corresponding
sections of said documentation chapter.  But this is a tedious task.
Here is an alternative approach that makes this task easier.

  1. Add the Gnulib module 'posixcheck' to the Gnulib imports of your
     package, as described earlier in this chapter.

  2. Do a 'make distclean' if you previously built in the top-level
     directory.  Then regenerate the Autotools-generated parts of the
     package.

  3. On a glibc system, build your package.  Pay attention to the
     compiler warnings.  Warnings are generated for uses of ISO C and
     POSIX functions that have portability problems or other important
     pitfalls and for which you have not yet imported the corresponding
     Gnulib module.  If you get, say, a warning "warning: call to
     'close' declared with attribute warning: close does not portably
     work on sockets - use gnulib module close for portability", put
     'close' on your list of modules to import.

  4. Add the modules you noted to the Gnulib imports of your package.

  5. Optionally, you can do the same steps again, and make sure that
     there are no warnings left except those that you want to
     intentionally ignore.

  6. Finally, remove the Gnulib module 'posixcheck' from the Gnulib
     imports, and run 'make distclean'.

3.8 Modifying the build rules of a Gnulib import directory
==========================================================

   In some cases, you may want to set additional compiler options for
use within the Gnulib import directory.  For example, the 'relocatable'
module operates better if you define the C macros
'ENABLE_COSTLY_RELOCATABLE' and 'INSTALLDIR' during its compilation.

   There are two ways to do so: Use of the 'gnulib-tool' option
'--makefile-name', and a kitchen-sink module.

   With the 'gnulib-tool' option '--makefile-name', you are telling
'gnulib-tool' to generate an includable 'Makefile.am' portion, rather
than a self-contained 'Makefile.am'.  For example, when you use
'--makefile-name=Makefile.gnulib', 'gnulib-tool' will generate
'Makefile.gnulib', and you will provide a hand-written 'Makefile.am'
that includes 'Makefile.gnulib' through a line such as
     include Makefile.gnulib
   Before this include, you need to initialize this set of 'Makefile.am'
variables:
   * 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS'
   * 'SUBDIRS'
   * 'noinst_HEADERS'
   * 'noinst_LIBRARIES'
   * 'noinst_LTLIBRARIES'
   * 'pkgdata_DATA' (only with Automake >= 1.11.4)
   * 'EXTRA_DIST'
   * 'BUILT_SOURCES'
   * 'SUFFIXES'
   * 'MOSTLYCLEANFILES'
   * 'MOSTLYCLEANDIRS'
   * 'CLEANFILES'
   * 'DISTCLEANFILES'
   * 'MAINTAINERCLEANFILES'
   * 'AM_CPPFLAGS'
   * 'AM_CFLAGS'
   'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS' should be initialized as described in *note
Changing Automake's Behavior: (automake)Options.  The other variables
can be initialized to empty.  However, you will most likely want to
initialize some of them with non-empty values, in order to achieve the
desired customization.

   The other approach, the kitchen-sink module, is more advanced.  See
chapter *note Extending Gnulib::.

3.9 Using Gnulib for both a library and a program
=================================================

   Your project might build both a library and some accompanying
programs in the same source tree.  In that case you might want to use
different modules for the library than for the programs.  Typically the
programs might want to make use of 'getopt-posix' or 'version-etc',
while the library wants to stay clear of these modules for technical or
licensing reasons.

   Let's assume that your project contains a 'lib' directory where the
source of the library resides and a 'src' directory for the sources of
the programs as follows.

     .
     |-- configure.ac
     |-- lib
     |   |-- foo.c
     |   `-- Makefile.am
     |-- Makefile.am
     `-- src
         |-- bar.c
         `-- Makefile.am

   You can now add two instances of Gnulib to your project in separate
source trees:

     ~/src/libfoo$ gnulib-tool --import --lib=libgnu --source-base=gnulib \
                   --m4-base=gnulib/m4 --macro-prefix=gl strndup
     ~/src/libfoo$ gnulib-tool --import --lib=libgnutools \
                   --source-base=src/gnulib --m4-base=src/gnulib/m4 \
                   --macro-prefix=gl_tools getopt-gnu

   The first one will import the module 'strndup' in 'gnulib' and the
second one will import 'getopt-gnu' in 'src/gnulib' and you will end up
with the following source tree (many files omitted in the interest of
brevity):

     .
     |-- configure.ac
     |-- gnulib
     |   |-- m4
     |   |-- strndup.c
     |-- lib
     |   |-- foo.c
     |   `-- Makefile.am
     |-- Makefile.am
     `-- src
         |-- bar.c
         |-- gnulib
         |   |-- getopt.c
         |   |-- getopt.in.h
         |   |-- m4
         `-- Makefile.am

   Integration with your code is basically the same as outlined in *note
Initial import:: with the one exception that you have to add both the
macro 'gl_EARLY' and the macro 'gl_tools_EARLY' to your 'configure.ac'
(and of course also both macros 'gl_INIT' and 'gl_tools_INIT').
Obviously the name of the second macro is dependent on the value of the
'--macro-prefix' option in your 'gnulib-tool' invocation.

     ...
     AC_PROG_CC
     gl_EARLY
     gl_tools_EARLY
     ...
     # For gnulib.
     gl_INIT
     gl_tools_INIT
     ...

   Also as outlined in *note Initial import:: you will have to add
compiler and linker flags.  For the library you might have to add
something along the line of the following to your 'Makefile.am':

     ...
     AM_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/gnulib -I$(top_builddir)/gnulib
     ...
     libfoo_la_LIBADD = $(top_builddir)/gnulib/libgnu.la
     ...

   Correspondingly for the programs you will have to add something like
this:

     ...
     AM_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/src/gnulib -I$(top_builddir)/src/gnulib
     ...
     LIBADD = $(top_builddir)/src/gnulib/libgnutools.la
     ...

   The name of the library that you have pass in the linker option
depends on the '--lib' option in 'gnulib-tool' invocation.

3.10 Caveat: 'gettextize' and 'autopoint' users
===============================================

   The programs 'gettextize' and 'autopoint', part of GNU 'gettext',
import or update the internationalization infrastructure.  Some of this
infrastructure, namely ca. 20 Autoconf macro files and the
'config.rpath' file, is also contained in Gnulib and may be imported by
'gnulib-tool'.  The use of 'gettextize' or 'autopoint' will therefore
overwrite some of the files that 'gnulib-tool' has imported, and vice
versa.

   Avoiding to use 'gettextize' (manually, as package maintainer) or
'autopoint' (as part of a script like 'autoreconf' or 'autogen.sh') is
not the solution: These programs also import the infrastructure in the
'po/' and optionally in the 'intl/' directory.

   The copies of the conflicting files in Gnulib are more up-to-date
than the copies brought in by 'gettextize' and 'autopoint'.  When a new
'gettext' release is made, the copies of the files in Gnulib will be
updated immediately.

   The choice of which version of gettext to require depends on the
needs of your package.  For a package that wants to comply to GNU Coding
Standards, the steps are:

  1. When you run 'gettextize', always use the 'gettextize' from the
     matching GNU gettext release.  For the most recent Gnulib checkout,
     this is the newest release found on
     <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/>.  For an older Gnulib snapshot,
     it is the release that was the most recent release at the time the
     Gnulib snapshot was taken.

  2. After running 'gettextize', invoke 'gnulib-tool' and import the
     'gettext' module.  Also, copy the latest version of gnulib's
     'build-aux/po/Makefile.in.in' to your 'po/' directory (this is done
     for you if you use gnulib's 'bootstrap' script).

  3. If you get an error message like '*** error: gettext infrastructure
     mismatch: using a Makefile.in.in from gettext version ... but the
     Autoconf macros are from gettext version ...', it means that a new
     GNU gettext release was made, and its Autoconf macros were
     integrated into Gnulib and now mismatch the 'po/' infrastructure.
     In this case, fetch and install the new GNU gettext release and run
     'gettextize' followed by 'gnulib-tool'.

   On the other hand, if your package is not as concerned with
compliance to the latest standards, but instead favors development on
stable environments, the steps are:

  1. Determine the oldest version of 'gettext' that you intend to
     support during development (at this time, gnulib recommends going
     no older than version 0.17).  Run 'autopoint' (not 'gettextize') to
     copy infrastructure into place (newer versions of gettext will
     install the older infrastructure that you requested).

  2. Invoke 'gnulib-tool', and import the 'gettext-h' module.

   Regardless of which approach you used to get the infrastructure in
place, the following steps must then be used to preserve that
infrastructure (gnulib's 'bootstrap' script follows these rules):

  1. When a script of yours run 'autopoint', invoke 'gnulib-tool'
     afterwards.

  2. When you invoke 'autoreconf' after 'gnulib-tool', make sure to not
     invoke 'autopoint' a second time, by setting the 'AUTOPOINT'
     environment variable, like this:
          $ env AUTOPOINT=true autoreconf --install

3.11 Handling Gnulib's own message translations
===============================================

   Gnulib provides some functions that emit translatable messages using
GNU 'gettext'.  The 'gnulib' domain at the Translation Project
(https://translationproject.org/) collects translations of these
messages, which you should incorporate into your own programs.

   There are two basic ways to achieve this.  The first, and older,
method is to list all the source files you use from Gnulib in your own
'po/POTFILES.in' file.  This will cause all the relevant translatable
strings to be included in your POT file.  When you send this POT file to
the Translation Project, translators will normally fill in the
translations of the Gnulib strings from their "translation memory", and
send you back updated PO files.

   However, this process is error-prone: you might forget to list some
source files, or the translator might not be using a translation memory
and provide a different translation than another translator, or the
translation might not be kept in sync between Gnulib and your package.
It is also slow and causes substantial extra work, because a human
translator must be in the loop for each language and you will need to
incorporate their work on request.

   For these reasons, a new method was designed and is now recommended.
If you pass the '--po-base=DIRECTORY' and '--po-domain=DOMAIN' options
to 'gnulib-tool', then 'gnulib-tool' will create a separate directory
with its own 'POTFILES.in', and fetch current translations directly from
the Translation Project (using 'rsync' or 'wget', whichever is
available).  The POT file in this directory will be called
'DOMAIN-gnulib.pot', depending on the DOMAIN you gave to the
'--po-domain' option (typically the same as the package name).  This
causes these translations to reside in a separate message domain, so
that they do not clash either with the translations for the main part of
your package nor with those of other packages on the system that use
possibly different versions of Gnulib.  When you use these options, the
functions in Gnulib are built in such a way that they will always use
this domain regardless of the default domain set by 'textdomain'.

   In order to use this method, you must--in each program that might use
Gnulib code--add an extra line to the part of the program that
initializes locale-dependent behavior.  Where you would normally write
something like:

       setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
       bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR);
       textdomain (PACKAGE);

you should add an additional 'bindtextdomain' call to inform gettext of
where the MO files for the extra message domain may be found:

       bindtextdomain (PACKAGE "-gnulib", LOCALEDIR);

   (This example assumes that the DOMAIN that you specified to
'gnulib-tool' is the same as the value of the 'PACKAGE' preprocessor
macro.)

   Since you do not change the 'textdomain' call, the default message
domain for your program remains the same and your own use of 'gettext'
functions will not be affected.

3.12 Issues with Version Control Systems
========================================

   If a project stores its source files in a version control system
(VCS), such as CVS, Subversion, or Git, one needs to decide which files
to commit.

   In principle, all files created by 'gnulib-tool', except
'gnulib-cache.m4', can be treated like generated source files, like for
example a 'parser.c' file generated from 'parser.y'.  Alternatively,
they can be considered source files and updated manually.

   Here are the three different approaches in common use.  Each has its
place, and you should use whichever best suits your particular project
and development methods.

  1. In projects which commit all source files, whether generated or
     not, into their VCS, the 'gnulib-tool' generated files should all
     be committed.  In this case, you should pass the option
     '--no-vc-files' to 'gnulib-tool', which avoids alteration of
     VCS-related files such as '.gitignore'.

     Gnulib also contains files generated by 'make' (and removed by
     'make clean'), using information determined by 'configure'.  For a
     Gnulib source file of the form 'lib/foo.in.h', the corresponding
     'lib/foo.h' is such a 'make'-generated file.  These should _not_ be
     checked into the VCS, but instead added to '.gitignore' or
     equivalent.

  2. In projects which customarily omit from their VCS all files that
     are generated from other source files, none of these files and
     directories are added into the VCS.  As described in *note Modified
     imports::, there are two ways to keep track of options and module
     names that are passed to 'gnulib-tool'.  The command for restoring
     the omitted files depends on it:

        * If they are stored in a file other than 'gnulib-cache.m4',
          such as 'autogen.sh', 'bootstrap', 'bootstrap.conf', or
          similar, the restoration command is the entire 'gnulib-tool
          ... --import ...' invocation with all options and module
          names.

        * If the project relies on 'gnulib-tool''s memory of the last
          used options and module names, then the file 'gnulib-cache.m4'
          in the M4 macros directory must be added to the VCS, and the
          restoration command is:

               $ gnulib-tool --update

          The '--update' option operates much like the '--add-import'
          option, but it does not offer the possibility to change the
          way Gnulib is used.  Also it does not report in the ChangeLogs
          the files that it had to add because they were missing.

     Gnulib includes the file 'build-aux/bootstrap' to aid a developer
     in using this setup.  Furthermore, in projects that use git for
     version control, it is possible to use a git submodule containing
     the precise commit of the gnulib repository, so that each developer
     running 'bootstrap' will get the same version of all
     gnulib-provided files.  The location of the submodule can be chosen
     to fit the package's needs; here's how to initially create the
     submodule in the directory '.gnulib':

          $ dir=.gnulib
          $ git submodule add -- git://git.sv.gnu.org/gnulib.git $dir
          $ git config alias.syncsub "submodule foreach git pull origin master"

     Thereafter, 'bootstrap' can run this command to update the
     submodule to the recorded checkout level:

          git submodule update --init $dir

     and a developer can use this sequence to update to a newer version
     of gnulib:

          $ git syncsub
          $ git add $dir
          $ ./bootstrap

  3. Some projects take a "middle road": they do commit Gnulib source
     files as in the first approach, but they do not commit other
     derived files, such as a 'Makefile.in' generated by Automake.  This
     increases the size and complexity of the repository, but can help
     occasional contributors by not requiring them to have a full Gnulib
     checkout to do a build, and all developers by ensuring that all
     developers are working with the same version of Gnulib in the
     repository.  It also supports multiple Gnulib instances within a
     project.  It remains important not to commit the 'make'-generated
     files, as described above.

3.13 Bundling the unit tests of the Gnulib modules
==================================================

   You can bundle the unit tests of the Gnulib modules together with
your package, through the '--with-tests' option.  Together with
'--with-tests', you also specify the directory for these tests through
the '--tests-base' option.  Of course, you need to add this directory to
the 'SUBDIRS' variable in the 'Makefile.am' of the parent directory.

   The advantage of having the unit tests bundled is that when your
program has a problem on a particular platform, running the unit tests
may help determine quickly if the problem is on Gnulib's side or on your
package's side.  Also, it helps verifying Gnulib's portability, of
course.

   The unit tests will be compiled and run when the user runs 'make
check'.  When the user runs only 'make', the unit tests will not be
compiled.

   In the 'SUBDIRS' variable, it is useful to put the Gnulib tests
directory after the directory containing the other tests, not before:

     SUBDIRS = gnulib-lib src man tests gnulib-tests

This will ensure that on platforms where there are test failures in
either directory, users will see and report the failures from the tests
of your program.

   Note: In packages which use more than one invocation of 'gnulib-tool'
in the scope of the same 'configure.ac', you cannot use '--with-tests'.
You will have to use a separate 'configure.ac' in this case.

3.14 Avoiding unnecessary checks and compilations
=================================================

   In some cases, a module is needed by another module only on specific
platforms.  But when a module is present, its Autoconf checks are always
executed, and its 'Makefile.am' additions are always enabled.  So it can
happen that some Autoconf checks are executed and some source files are
compiled, although no other module needs them on this particular
platform, just _in case_ some other module would need them.

   The option '--conditional-dependencies' enables an optimization of
configure checks and 'Makefile.am' snippets that avoids this.  With this
option, whether a module is considered "present" is no longer decided
when 'gnulib-tool' is invoked, but later, when 'configure' is run.  This
applies to modules that were added as dependencies while 'gnulib-tool'
was run; modules that were passed on the command line explicitly are
always "present".

   For example, the 'timegm' module needs, on platforms where the
system's 'timegm' function is missing or buggy, a replacement that is
based on a function 'mktime_internal'.  The module 'mktime-internal'
that provides this function provides it on all platforms.  So, by
default, the file 'mktime-internal.c' will be compiled on all platforms,
even on glibc and BSD systems which have a working 'timegm' function.
When the option '--conditional-dependencies' is given, on the other
hand, and if 'mktime-internal' was not explicitly required on the
command line, the file 'mktime-internal.c' will only be compiled on the
platforms where the 'timegm' needs them.

   Conditional dependencies are specified in the module description by
putting the condition on the same line as the dependent module, enclosed
in brackets.  The condition is a boolean shell expression that can
assume that the 'configure.ac' snippet from the module description has
already been executed.  In the example above, the dependency from
'timegm' to 'mktime-internal' is written like this:

     Depends-on:
     ...
     mktime-internal [test $HAVE_TIMEGM = 0 || test $REPLACE_TIMEGM = 1]
     ...

   Note: The option '--conditional-dependencies' cannot be used together
with the option '--with-tests'.  It also cannot be used when a package
uses 'gnulib-tool' for several subdirectories, with different values of
'--source-base', in the scope of a single 'configure.ac' file.

4 Writing modules
*****************

   This chapter explains how to write modules of your own, either to
extend Gnulib for your own package (*note Extending Gnulib::), or for
inclusion in gnulib proper.

   The guidelines in this chapter do not necessarily need to be followed
for using 'gnulib-tool'.  They merely represent a set of good practices.
Following them will result in a good structure of your modules and in
consistency with gnulib.

4.1 Source code files
=====================

   Every API (C functions or variables) provided should be declared in a
header file (.h file) and implemented in one or more implementation
files (.c files).  The separation has the effect that users of your
module need to read only the contents of the .h file and the module
description in order to understand what the module is about and how to
use it--not the entire implementation.  Furthermore, users of your
module don't need to repeat the declarations of the functions in their
code, and are likely to receive notification through compiler errors if
you make incompatible changes to the API (like, adding a parameter or
changing the return type of a function).

4.2 Header files
================

   The .h file should declare the C functions and variables that the
module provides.

   The .h file should be stand-alone.  That is, it does not require
other .h files to be included before.  Rather, it includes all necessary
.h files by itself.

   It is a tradition to use CPP tricks to avoid parsing the same header
file more than once, which might cause warnings.  The trick is to wrap
the content of the header file (say, 'foo.h') in a block, as in:

     #ifndef FOO_H
     # define FOO_H
     ...
     body of header file goes here
     ...
     #endif /* FOO_H */

   Whether to use 'FOO_H' or '_FOO_H' is a matter of taste and style.
The C99 and C11 standards reserve all identifiers that begin with an
underscore and either an uppercase letter or another underscore, for any
use.  Thus, in theory, an application might not safely assume that
'_FOO_H' has not already been defined by a library.  On the other hand,
using 'FOO_H' will likely lead the higher risk of collisions with other
symbols (e.g., 'KEY_H', 'XK_H', 'BPF_H', which are CPP macro constants,
or 'COFF_LONG_H', which is a CPP macro function).  Your preference may
depend on whether you consider the header file under discussion as part
of the application (which has its own namespace for CPP symbols) or a
supporting library (that shouldn't interfere with the application's CPP
symbol namespace).

   Adapting C header files for use in C++ applications can use another
CPP trick, as in:

     # ifdef __cplusplus
     extern "C"
     {
     # endif
     ...
     body of header file goes here
     ...
     # ifdef __cplusplus
     }
     # endif

   The idea here is that '__cplusplus' is defined only by C++
implementations, which will wrap the header file in an 'extern "C"'
block.  Again, whether to use this trick is a matter of taste and style.
While the above can be seen as harmless, it could be argued that the
header file is written in C, and any C++ application using it should
explicitly use the 'extern "C"' block itself.  Your preference might
depend on whether you consider the API exported by your header file as
something available for C programs only, or for C and C++ programs
alike.

   Note that putting a '#include' in an 'extern "C" { ... }' block
yields a syntax error in C++ mode on some platforms (e.g., glibc systems
with g++ v3.3 to v4.2, AIX, IRIX). For this reason, it is recommended to
place the '#include' before the 'extern "C"' block.

4.3 Implementation files
========================

   The .c file or files implement the functions and variables declared
in the .h file.

Include ordering
----------------

   Every implementation file must start with '#include <config.h>'.
This is necessary for activating the preprocessor macros that are
defined on behalf of the Autoconf macros.  Some of these preprocessor
macros, such as '_GNU_SOURCE', would have no effect if defined after a
system header file has already been included.

   Then comes the '#include "..."' specifying the header file that is
being implemented.  Putting this right after '#include <config.h>' has
the effect that it verifies that the header file is self-contained.

   Then come the system and application headers.  It is customary to put
all the system headers before all application headers, so as to minimize
the risk that a preprocessor macro defined in an application header
confuses the system headers on some platforms.

   In summary:

   * First comes #include <config.h>.
   * Second comes the #include "..."  specifying the module being
     implemented.
   * Then come all the #include <...> of system or system-replacement
     headers, in arbitrary order.
   * Then come all the #include "..."  of gnulib and application
     headers, in arbitrary order.

4.4 Specification
=================

   The specification of a function should answer at least the following
questions:
   * What is the purpose of the function?
   * What are the arguments?
   * What is the return value?
   * What happens in case of failure?  (Exit?  A specific return value?
     Errno set?)
   * Memory allocation policy: If pointers to memory are returned, are
     they freshly allocated and supposed to be freed by the caller?

   Where to put the specification describing exported functions?  Three
practices are used in gnulib:

   * The specification can be as comments in the header file, just above
     the function declaration.
   * The specification can be as comments in the implementation file,
     just above the function definition.
   * The specification can be in texinfo format, so that it gets
     included in the gnulib manual.

   In any case, the specification should appear in just one place,
unless you can ensure that the multiple copies will always remain
identical.

   The advantage of putting it in the header file is that the user only
has to read the include file normally never needs to peek into the
implementation file(s).

   The advantage of putting it in the implementation file is that when
reviewing or changing the implementation, you have both elements side by
side.

   The advantage of texinfo formatted documentation is that it is easily
published in HTML or Info format.

   Currently (as of 2010), half of gnulib uses the first practice,
nearly half of gnulib uses the second practice, and a small minority
uses the texinfo practice.

4.5 Module description
======================

   For the module description, you can start from an existing module's
description, or from a blank one: 'module/TEMPLATE' for a normal module,
or 'module/TEMPLATE-TESTS' for a unit test module.  Some more fields are
possible but rarely used.  Use 'module/TEMPLATE-EXTENDED' if you want to
use one of them.

   Module descriptions have the following fields.  Absent fields are
equivalent to fields with empty contents.

Description
     This field should contain a concise description of the module's
     functionality.  One sentence is enough.  For example, if it defines
     a single function 'frob', the description can be 'frob() function:
     frobnication.' Gnulib's documentation generator will automatically
     convert the first part to a hyperlink when it has this form.

Status
     This field is either empty/absent, or contains the word 'obsolete'.
     In the latter case, 'gnulib-tool' will, unless the option
     '--with-obsolete' is given, omit it when it used as a dependency.
     It is good practice to also notify the user about an obsolete
     module.  This is done by putting into the 'Notice' section (see
     below) text like 'This module is obsolete.'

Notice
     This field contains text that 'gnulib-tool' will show to the user
     when the module is used.  This can be a status indicator like 'This
     module is obsolete.' or additional advice.  Do not abuse this
     field.

Applicability
     This field is either empty/absent, or contains the word 'all'.  It
     describes to which 'Makefile.am' the module is applied.  By
     default, a normal module is applied to 'SOURCE_BASE/Makefile.am'
     (normally 'lib/Makefile.am'), whereas a module ending in '-tests'
     is applied to 'TESTS_BASE/Makefile.am' (normally
     'tests/Makefile.am').  If this field is 'all', it is applied to
     both 'Makefile.am's.  This is useful for modules which provide
     Makefile.am macros rather than compiled source code.

Files
     This field contains a newline separated list of the files that are
     part of the module.  'gnulib-tool' copies these files into the
     package that uses the module.

     This list is typically ordered by importance: First comes the
     header file, then the implementation files, then other files.

     It is possible to have the same file mentioned in multiple modules.
     That is, if the maintainers of that module agree on the purpose and
     future of said file.

Depends-on
     This field contains a newline separated list of the modules that
     are required for the proper working of this module.  'gnulib-tool'
     includes each required module automatically, unless it is specified
     with option '--avoid' or it is marked as obsolete and the option
     '--with-obsolete' is not given.

     A test modules 'foo-tests' implicitly depends on the corresponding
     non-test module 'foo'.  'foo' implicitly depends on 'foo-tests' if
     the latter exists and if the option '--with-tests' has been given.

     Tests modules can depend on non-tests modules.  Non-tests modules
     should not depend on tests modules.  (Recall that tests modules are
     built in a separate directory.)

     Each listed required module may be declared a conditional
     dependency.  This is indicated by placing the condition for the
     dependency on the same line, enclosed in brackets, after the name
     of the required module.  The condition is a shell expression that
     is run after the module's 'configure.ac' statements.  For example:
          strtoull   [test $ac_cv_func_strtoumax = no]

     Lines starting with '#' are recognized as comments and are ignored.

configure.ac-early
     This field contains 'configure.ac' stuff (Autoconf macro
     invocations and shell statements) that are logically placed early
     in the 'configure.ac' file: right after the 'AC_PROG_CC'
     invocation.  This section is adequate for statements that modify
     'CPPFLAGS', as these can affect the results of other Autoconf
     macros.

configure.ac
     This field contains 'configure.ac' stuff (Autoconf macro
     invocations and shell statements).

     It is forbidden to add items to the 'CPPFLAGS' variable here, other
     than temporarily, as these could affect the results of other
     Autoconf macros.

     We avoid adding items to the 'LIBS' variable, other than
     temporarily.  Instead, the module can export an
     Autoconf-substituted variable that contains link options.  The user
     of the module can then decide to which executables to apply which
     link options.  Recall that a package can build executables of
     different kinds and purposes; having all executables link against
     all libraries is inappropriate.

     If the statements in this section grow larger than a couple of
     lines, we recommend moving them to a '.m4' file of their own.

Makefile.am
     This field contains 'Makefile.am' statements.  Variables like
     'lib_SOURCES' are transformed to match the name of the library
     being built in that directory.  For example, 'lib_SOURCES' may
     become 'libgnu_a_SOURCES' (for a plain library) or
     'libgnu_la_SOURCES' (for a libtool library).  Therefore, the normal
     way of having an implementation file 'lib/foo.c' compiled
     unconditionally is to write
          lib_SOURCES += foo.c

Include
     This field contains the preprocessor statements that users of the
     module need to add to their source code files.  Typically it's a
     single include statement.  A shorthand is allowed: You don't need
     to write the word "#include", just the name of the include file in
     the way it will appear in an include statement.  Example:
          "foo.h"

Link
     This field contains the set of libraries that are needed when
     linking libraries or executables that use this module.  Often this
     will be written as a reference to a Makefile variable.  Please
     write them one per line, so that 'gnulib-tool' can remove
     duplicates when presenting a summary to the user.  Example:
          $(POW_LIBM)
          $(LTLIBICONV) when linking with libtool, $(LIBICONV) otherwise
     When this field is omitted, it defaults to the union of the 'Link'
     field of the dependencies.

License
     This field specifies the license that governs the source code parts
     of this module.  See *note Copyright:: for details.

Maintainer
     This field specifies the persons who have a definitive say about
     proposed changes to this module.  You don't need to mention email
     addresses here: they can be inferred from the 'ChangeLog' file.

     Please put at least one person here.  We don't like unmaintained
     modules.

4.6 Autoconf macros
===================

   For a module 'foo', an Autoconf macro file 'm4/foo.m4' is typically
created when the Autoconf macro invocations for the module are longer
than one or two lines.

   The name of the main entry point into this Autoconf macro file is
typically 'gl_FOO'.  For modules outside Gnulib that are not likely to
be moved into Gnulib, please use a prefix specific to your package:
'gt_' for GNU gettext, 'cu_' for GNU coreutils, etc.

   For modules that define a function 'foo', the entry point is called
'gl_FUNC_FOO' instead of 'gl_FOO'.  For modules that provide a header
file with multiple functions, say 'foo.h', the entry point is called
'gl_FOO_H' or 'gl_HEADER_FOO_H'.  This convention is useful because
sometimes a header and a function name coincide (for example, 'fcntl'
and 'fcntl.h').

   For modules that provide a replacement, it is useful to split the
Autoconf macro into two macro definitions: one that detects whether the
replacement is needed and requests the replacement using 'AC_LIBOBJ'
(this is the entry point, say 'gl_FUNC_FOO'), and one that arranges for
the macros needed by the replacement code 'lib/foo.c' (typically called
'gl_PREREQ_FOO').  The reason of this separation is
  1. to make it easy to update the Autoconf macros when you have
     modified the source code file: after changing 'lib/foo.c', all you
     have to review is the 'Depends-on' section of the module
     description and the 'gl_PREREQ_FOO' macro in the Autoconf macro
     file.
  2. The Autoconf macros are often large enough that splitting them
     eases maintenance.

4.7 Unit test modules
=====================

   A unit test that is a simple C program usually has a module
description as simple as this:

     Files:
     tests/test-foo.c
     tests/macros.h

     Depends-on:

     configure.ac:

     Makefile.am:
     TESTS += test-foo
     check_PROGRAMS += test-foo

   The test program 'tests/test-foo.c' often has the following
structure:

   * First comes the obligatory '#include <config.h>'.

   * Second comes the include of the header file that declares the API
     being tested.  Including it here verifies that said header file is
     self-contained.

   * Then come other includes.  In particular, the file 'macros.h' is
     often used here.  It contains a convenient 'ASSERT' macro.

   The body of the test, then, contains many 'ASSERT' invocations.  When
a test fails, the 'ASSERT' macro prints the line number of the failing
statement, thus giving you, the developer, an idea of which part of the
test failed, even when you don't have access to the machine where the
test failed and the reporting user cannot run a debugger.

   Sometimes it is convenient to write part of the test as a shell
script.  (For example, in areas related to process control or
interprocess communication, or when different locales should be tried.)
In these cases, the typical module description is like this:

     Files:
     tests/test-foo.sh
     tests/test-foo.c
     tests/macros.h

     Depends-on:

     configure.ac:

     Makefile.am:
     TESTS += test-foo.sh
     TESTS_ENVIRONMENT += FOO_BAR='@FOO_BAR@'
     check_PROGRAMS += test-foo

   Here, the 'TESTS_ENVIRONMENT' variable can be used to pass values
determined by 'configure' or by the 'Makefile' to the shell script, as
environment variables.  The Autoconf values 'EXEEXT' and 'srcdir' are
already provided as environment variables, through an initial value of
'TESTS_ENVIRONMENT' that 'gnulib-tool' puts in place.

   Regardless of the specific form of the unit test, the following
guidelines should be respected:

   * A test indicates success by exiting with exit code 0.  It should
     normally not produce output in this case.  (Output to temporary
     files that are cleaned up at the end of the test are possible, of
     course.)
   * A test indicates failure by exiting with an exit code different
     from 0 and 77, typically 1.  It is useful to print a message about
     the failure in this case.  The 'ASSERT' macro already does so.
   * A test indicates "skip", that is, that most of its interesting
     functionality could not be performed, through a return code of 77.
     A test should also print a message to stdout or stderr about the
     reason for skipping.  For example:
            fputs ("Skipping test: multithreading not enabled\n", stderr);
            return 77;
     Such a message helps detecting bugs in the autoconf macros: A
     simple message 'SKIP: test-foo' does not sufficiently catch the
     attention of the user.

4.8 Incompatible changes
========================

   Incompatible changes to Gnulib modules should be mentioned in
Gnulib's 'NEWS' file.  Incompatible changes here mean that existing
source code may not compile or work any more.

   We don't mean changes in the binary interface (ABI), since
  1. Gnulib code is used in source-code form.
  2. The user who distributes libraries that contain Gnulib code is
     supposed to bump the version number in the way described in the
     Libtool documentation before every release.

5 Extending Gnulib
******************

   Gnulib modules are intended to be suitable for widespread use.  Most
problems with Gnulib can and should be fixed in a generic way, so that
all of Gnulib's users can benefit from the change.  But occasionally a
problem arises that is difficult or undesirable to fix generically, or a
project that uses Gnulib may need to work around an issue before the
Gnulib maintainers commit a final fix.  Maintainers may also want to add
their own pools of modules to projects as Gnulib "staging areas."

   The obvious way to make local changes to Gnulib modules is to use
'gnulib-tool' to check out pristine modules, then to modify the results
in-place.  This works well enough for short-lived experiments.  It is
harder to keep modified versions of Gnulib modules for a long time, even
though Git (or another distributed version control systems) can help out
a lot with this during the development process.

   Git, however, doesn't address the distribution issue.  When a package
"foobar" needs a modified version of, say, 'stdint.in.h', it either has
to put a comment into 'foobar/autogen.sh' saying "Attention!  This
doesn't work with a pristine Gnulib, you need this and that patch after
checking out Gnulib," or it has to use the '--avoid=stdint' option and
provide the modified 'stdint' module in a different directory.

   The '--local-dir' option to 'gnulib-tool' solves this problem.  It
allows the package to override or augment Gnulib.  This means:

   * You can store files that are to override Gnulib files or modules.

   * You can store context diffs to be applied to Gnulib files.

   * You can add modules of your own, that are not (yet) in Gnulib.

   * You can also add unstructured amounts of code to the library, by
     grouping the non-Gnulib files of the library in a single
     kitchen-sink "module."  (This kind of kitchen-sink module is not
     needed when you use the 'gnulib-tool' option '--makefile-name'.)

   In a release tarball, you can distribute the contents of this
'--local-dir' directory that will be combinable with newer versions of
Gnulib, barring incompatible changes to Gnulib.

   If the '--local-dir=DIRECTORY' option is specified, then
'gnulib-tool' looks in 'DIRECTORY' whenever it reads a file from the
Gnulib directory.  Suppose 'gnulib-tool' is looking for FILE.  Then:

   * If 'DIRECTORY/FILE' exists, then 'gnulib-tool' uses it instead of
     the file included in Gnulib.

   * Otherwise, if 'DIRECTORY/FILE.diff' exists, then 'gnulib-tool' uses
     the file from Gnulib after applying the diff using the 'patch'
     program.

   * Otherwise, 'gnulib-tool' uses the file included in Gnulib.

   You can specify the '--local-dir' multiple times.  In this case, the
first specified directory has the highest precedence.  That is, a 'FILE'
found in one directory will shadow any 'FILE' and 'FILE.diff' in the
later directories and in the Gnulib directory.  And a file 'FILE.diff'
found in one directory will be applied on top of the combination of
'FILE' and 'FILE.diff' files found in the later directories and in the
Gnulib directory.

   Please make wise use of this option.  It also allows you to easily
hold back modifications you make to Gnulib macros in cases it may be
better to share them.

6 Miscellaneous Notes
*********************

6.1 Out of memory handling
==========================

   The gnulib API does not have a standard error code for the out of
memory error condition.  Instead of adding a non-standard error code,
gnulib has chosen to adopt a different strategy.  Out of memory handling
happens in rare situations, but performing the out of memory error
handling after almost all API function invocations pollute your source
code and might make it harder to spot more serious problems.  The
strategy chosen improves code readability and robustness.

   For most applications, aborting the application with an error message
when the out of memory situation occurs is the best that can be wished
for.  This is how the library behaves by default (using the 'xalloc-die'
module).

   However, we realize that some applications may not want to abort
execution in any situation.  Gnulib supports a hook to let the
application regain control and perform its own cleanups when an out of
memory situation has occurred.  The application can define a function
(having a 'void' prototype, i.e., no return value and no parameters) and
set the library variable 'xalloc_die' to that function.  The variable
should be declared as follows.

     extern void (*xalloc_die) (void);

   Gnulib will invoke this function if an out of memory error occurs.
Note that the function should not return.  Of course, care must be taken
to not allocate more memory, as that will likely also fail.

6.2 Obsolete modules
====================

   Modules can be marked obsolete.  This means that the problems they
fix don't occur any more on the platforms that are reasonable porting
targets now.  'gnulib-tool' warns when obsolete modules are mentioned on
the command line, and by default ignores dependencies from modules to
obsolete modules.  When you pass the option '--with-obsolete' to
'gnulib-tool', dependencies to obsolete modules will be included,
however, unless blocked through an '--avoid' option.  This option is
useful if your package should be portable even to very old platforms.

   In order to mark a module obsolete, you need to add this to the
module description:

     Status:
     obsolete

     Notice:
     This module is obsolete.

6.3 Extra tests modules
=======================

   Test modules can be marked with some special status attributes.  When
a test module has such an attribute, 'gnulib-tool --import' will not
include it by default.

   The supported status attributes are:

'c++-test'
     Indicates that the test is testing C++ interoperability.  Such a
     test is useful in a C++ or mixed C/C++ package, but is useless in a
     C package.

'longrunning-test'
     Indicates that the test takes a long time to compile or execute
     (more than five minutes or so).  Such a test is better avoided in a
     release that is made for the general public.

'privileged-test'
     Indicates that the test will request special privileges, for
     example, ask for the superuser password.  Such a test may hang when
     run non-interactively and is therefore better avoided in a release
     that is made for the general public.

'unportable-test'
     Indicates that the test is known to fail on some systems, and that
     there is no workaround about it.  Such a test is better avoided in
     a release that is made for the general public.

   'gnulib-tool --import --with-tests' will not include tests marked
with these attributes by default.  When 'gnulib-tool' is invoked with
one of the options '--with-c++-tests', '--with-longrunning-tests',
'--with-privileged-tests', '--with-unportable-tests', it will include
tests despite the corresponding special status attribute.  When
'gnulib-tool' receives the option '--with-all-tests', it will include
all tests regardless of their status attributes.

   'gnulib-tool --create-testdir --with-tests' and 'gnulib-tool
--create-megatestdir --with-tests' by default include all tests of
modules specified on the command line, regardless of their status
attributes.  Tests of modules occurring as dependencies are not included
by default if they have one of these status attributes.  The options
'--with-c++-tests', '--with-longrunning-tests',
'--with-privileged-tests', '--with-unportable-tests' are recognized here
as well.  Additionally, 'gnulib-tool' also understands the options
'--without-c++-tests', '--without-longrunning-tests',
'--without-privileged-tests', '--without-unportable-tests'.

   In order to mark a module with a status attribute, you need to add it
to the module description, like this:

     Status:
     longrunning-test

   If only a part of a test deserves a particular status attribute, you
can split the module into a primary and a secondary test module, say
'foo-tests' and 'foo-extra-tests'.  Then add a dependency from
'foo-tests' to 'foo-extra-tests', and mark the 'foo-extra-tests' with
the particular status attribute.

6.4 Modules that modify the way other modules work
==================================================

   The normal way to design modules is that each module has its own
code, and the module dependencies provide the facilities on which this
code can rely.  But sometimes it is necessary to use more advanced
techniques.  For example:
   * You may want to have optional module dependencies: Let module A use
     facilities provided by module B, if module B is present, but
     without requiring that module B is present.
   * A module can indicate support for particular behaviours.  For
     example, Gnulib has a module 'sigpipe' that requests POSIX
     compatible SIGPIPE behaviour from all other modules - something
     that is not enabled by default.  Or consider the 'nonblocking'
     module, that is an indicator that all I/O functions should handle
     non-blocking file descriptors - something that, equally, is not
     enabled by default.
   * A module can indicate to other modules that they can rely on
     certain guarantees, and thus omit specific code.  For example, when
     Gnulib's 'malloc-gnu' module is present, you can omit code that
     test 'n' against zero when you call 'malloc (n)'.

   Be aware that these advanced techniques likely cause breakage in the
situation of multiple 'gnulib-tool' invocations in the scope of a single
'configure' file.  This is because the question "is module B present?"
does not have a unique answer in such situations.  'gnulib-tool' has
support for these techniques in the situation of '--create-testdir
--single-configure', which basically has two 'gnulib-tool' invocations,
one for a set of modules that end up in 'gllib', and one for the set of
modules that end up in 'gltests'.  But you should be aware that this
does not cover the general situation.

   Which technique to use, depends on the answer to the question: "If my
module occurs among the modules of 'gltests', should it have an effect
on the modules in 'gllib'?"

   If the answer is "no", your module description should invoke the
Autoconf macro 'gl_MODULE_INDICATOR'.  This Autoconf macro takes one
argument: the name of your module.  The effect of
'gl_MODULE_INDICATOR([MY-MODULE])' is to define, in 'config.h', a C
macro 'GNULIB_MY_MODULE' that indicates whether your macro is considered
to be present.  This works even when your macro is used in 'gltests':
'GNULIB_MY_MODULE' will then evaluate to 1 in 'gltests' but to 0 in
'gllib'.

   If the answer is "yes", you have two techniques available.  The first
one is to invoke a similar Autoconf macro, named
'gl_MODULE_INDICATOR_FOR_TESTS'.  It works similarly.  However, when
your macro is used in 'gltests', 'GNULIB_MY_MODULE' will evaluate to 1
both in 'gltests' and in 'gllib'.

   The second one is to define a shell variable in the 'configure' file
that tells whether your module is present, through use of
'm4_divert_text'.  The Autoconf macros of a dependency module will
initialize this shell variable, through 'm4_divert_text([DEFAULTS],
[MY_SHELL_VAR=no])'.  The Autoconf macros of your module will override
this value, through 'm4_divert_text([INIT_PREPARE],
[MY_SHELL_VAR=yes])'.  Then you can use 'MY_SHELL_VAR' in the Autoconf
macros of both modules.  You can find more details about this technique
in the Gnulib module 'getopt-gnu'.

   Reminder: These techniques are advanced.  They have the potential to
cause lots of headaches if you apply them incorrectly.

6.5 A C++ namespace for gnulib
==============================

   The function definitions provided by Gnulib ('.c' code) are meant to
be compiled by a C compiler.  The header files ('.h' files), on the
other hand, can be used in either C or C++.

   By default, when used in a C++ compilation unit, the '.h' files
declare the same symbols and overrides as in C mode, except that
functions defined by Gnulib or by the system are declared as 'extern
"C"'.

   It is also possible to indicate to Gnulib to provide many of its
symbols in a dedicated C++ namespace.  If you define the macro
'GNULIB_NAMESPACE' to an identifier, many functions will be defined in
the namespace specified by the identifier instead of the global
namespace.  For example, after you have defined
     #define GNULIB_NAMESPACE gnulib
at the beginning of a compilation unit, Gnulib's '<fcntl.h>' header file
will make available the 'open' function as 'gnulib::open'.  The symbol
'open' will still refer to the system's 'open' function, with its
platform specific bugs and limitations.

   The symbols provided in the Gnulib namespace are those for which the
corresponding header file contains a '_GL_CXXALIAS_RPL' or
'_GL_CXXALIAS_SYS' macro invocation.

   The benefits of this namespace mode are:
   * Gnulib defines fewer symbols as preprocessor macros.  For example,
     on a platform where 'open' has to be overridden, Gnulib normally
     does '#define open rpl_open'.  If your package has a class with a
     member 'open', for example a class 'foo' with a method 'foo::open',
     then if you define this member in a compilation unit that includes
     '<fcntl.h>' and use it in a compilation unit that does not include
     '<fcntl.h>', or vice versa, you will get a link error.  Worse: You
     will not notice this problem on the platform where the system's
     'open' function works fine.  This problem goes away in namespace
     mode.

   * It provides a safety check whether the set of modules your package
     requests from Gnulib is sufficient.  For example, if you use the
     function 'gnulib::open' in your code, and you forgot to request the
     module 'open' from Gnulib, you will get a compilation error
     (regardless of the platform).

   The drawback of this namespace mode is that the system provided
symbols in the global namespace are still present, even when they
contain bugs that Gnulib fixes.  For example, if you call 'open (...)'
in your code, it will invoke the possibly buggy system function, even if
you have requested the module 'open' from gnulib-tool.

   You can turn on the namespace mode in some compilation units and keep
it turned off in others.  This can be useful if your package consists of
an application layer that does not need to invoke POSIX functions and an
operating system interface layer that contains all the OS function
calls.  In such a situation, you will want to turn on the namespace mode
for the application layer--to avoid many preprocessor macro
definitions--and turn it off for the OS interface layer--to avoid the
drawback of the namespace mode, mentioned above.

6.6 License Texinfo sources
===========================

   Gnulib provides copies of the GNU GPL, GNU LGPL, GNU Affero GPL, and
GNU FDL licenses in Texinfo form.  (The master location is
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>).  These Texinfo documents do not have
any node names and structures built into them; for your manual, you
should '@include' them in an appropriate '@node'.

   The conventional name for the GPL node is 'Copying' and for the FDL
'GNU Free Documentation License'.  The LGPL doesn't seem to have a
conventional node name.

   Of course the license texts themselves should not be changed at all.

   The recommended way to make use of these license files, consistently
with current practice, is as follows:
   * The code license (GNU GPL, GNU LGPL, or GNU Affero GPL) is usually
     present as a file in the top-level directory.  This is true not
     only for the release tarballs, but also in the VCS repository.  The
     file is typically named 'COPYING' for the GNU GPL, or 'COPYING.LIB'
     or 'COPYING.LESSER' for the GNU LGPL.  The presence of this file
     fulfills a legal obligation; see
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhyMustIInclude>.

     To make use of the code license in your documentation, you may
     request one of the modules 'gpl-3.0', 'gpl-2.0', 'lgpl-3.0',
     'lgpl-2.1', 'agpl-3.0', through a 'gnulib-tool' invocation.  Or you
     may copy the relevant Texinfo file directly into your VCS
     repository.  Both approaches are equally good.  The Texinfo file
     changes very rarely.
   * The documentation license file (GNU FDL) is usually not present as
     a file in the top-level directory, because that would be ambiguous:
     When you use the GNU FDL, you need to specify the Invariant
     Sections, the Front-Cover Texts, and the Back-Cover Texts.

     To make use of this documentation license, copy the relevant
     Texinfo file into your VCS repository.  This makes sure that anyone
     who receives a copy of your VCS repository has also received a copy
     of the documentation license.  In the documentation, also state
     what are the Invariant Sections, the Front-Cover Texts, and the
     Back-Cover Texts.

6.7 Building gnulib
===================

   If you wish to help the gnulib development effort with build logs for
your favorite platform, you may perform these steps:

  1. Prerequisites tools

     Install the proper development tools.  To build and test all of
     Gnulib, you will need development tools for the programming
     languages C, C++, Java, and Perl, along with standard POSIX
     utilities such as 'awk', 'make' and 'sh'.  You will also need
     development tools that include Autoconf, Automake, Bison, Gettext,
     Git, GNU M4, Gperf, Libtool, and Texinfo.  Some of these tools are
     needed only by some modules.  More details can be found in Gnulib's
     'DEPENDENCIES' file.

  2. Obtain Gnulib

     See <https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/> for how to get the
     current Gnulib sources via Git.

  3. Create gnulib directory

     On a machine with GNU development tools installed and with a gnulib
     git checkout, use

          gnulib-tool --create-megatestdir --with-tests --dir=...

     Note: The created directory uses ca.  512 MB on disk.

  4. Transfer gnulib directory

     Transfer this directory to a build machine (HP-UX, Cygwin, or
     whatever).  Often it is easier to transfer one file, and this can
     be achieved by running, inside the directory the following
     commands:

          ./configure
          make dist

     And then transferring the 'dummy-0.tar.gz' file.

  5. Build modules

     On the build machine, run ./do-autobuild (or "nohup
     ./do-autobuild").  It creates a directory 'logs/' with a log file
     for each module.

7 Building the ISO C and POSIX Substitutes
******************************************

   This section shows a radically different way to use Gnulib.

   You can extract the ISO C / POSIX substitutes part of gnulib by
running the command
     gnulib-tool --create-testdir --source-base=lib \
                 --dir=/tmp/posixlib `posix-modules`

The command 'posix-modules' is found in the same directory as
'gnulib-tool'.

   The resulting directory can be built on a particular platform,
independently of the program being ported.  Then you can configure and
build any program, by setting 'CPPFLAGS' and 'LDFLAGS' at configure time
accordingly: set 'CPPFLAGS="-I.../posixlib/lib"', plus any essential
type definitions and flags that you find in '.../posixlib/config.h', and
set 'LDFLAGS=".../posixlib/lib/libgnu.a"'.

   This way of using Gnulib is useful when you don't want to modify the
program's source code, or when the program uses a mix between C and C++
sources (requiring separate builds of the 'posixlib' for the C compiler
and for the C++ compiler).

8 ISO C and POSIX Header File Substitutes
*****************************************

   This chapter describes which header files specified by ISO C or POSIX
are substituted by Gnulib, which portability pitfalls are fixed by
Gnulib, and which (known) portability problems are not worked around by
Gnulib.

   The notation "Gnulib module: --" means that Gnulib does not provide a
module providing a substitute for the header file.  When the list
"Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib" is empty, such a module is
not needed: No portability problems are known.  Otherwise, it indicates
that such a module would be useful but is not available: No one so far
found this header file important enough to contribute a substitute for
it.  If you need this particular header file, you may write to
'<bug-gnulib at gnu dot org>'.

8.1 'aio.h'
===========

8.3 'assert.h'
==============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/assert.h.html>

   Gnulib module: assert-h

   See also the Gnulib modules 'assert' and 'verify'.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * On older platforms 'static_assert' and '_Static_assert' do not
     allow the second string-literal argument to be omitted.  For
     example, GCC versions before 9.1 do not support the single-argument
     'static_assert' that was standardized by C2X and C++17.
   * Even-older platforms do not support 'static_assert' or
     '_Static_assert' at all.  For example, GCC versions before 4.6 do
     not support '_Static_assert', and G++ versions before 4.3 do not
     support 'static_assert', which was standardized by C11 and C++11.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * C '_Static_assert' and C++ 'static_assert' are keywords that can be
     used without including '<assert.h>'.  The Gnulib substitutes are
     macros that require including '<assert.h>'.
   * The C 'static_assert' and '_Static_assert' can also be used within
     a 'struct' or 'union' specifier, in place of an ordinary
     declaration of a member of the struct or union.  The Gnulib
     substitute can be used only as an ordinary declaration.
   * In C99 and later, 'assert' can be applied to any scalar expression.
     In C89, the argument to 'assert' is of type 'int'.

   * Some systems define a 'struct dirent' member named 'd_namlen'
     containing the string length of 'd_name', but others do not: glibc
     2.23 on Linux, Minix 3.1.8, Solaris 11.4, Cygwin.  All of these,
     except Cygwin, have a member 'd_reclen' instead, that has a
     different semantics.

   * Some systems define a 'struct dirent' member named 'd_off'
     containing a magic cookie suitable as an argument to 'seekdir', but
     others do not: glibc 2.23 on Hurd, Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD 6.0,
     NetBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 6.7, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, Cygwin, mingw.

   * Some systems define a 'struct dirent' member named 'd_reclen'

   Gnulib module: fcntl-h

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * The type 'pid_t' is not defined on some platforms: MSVC 14.

   * The type 'mode_t' is not defined on some platforms: MSVC 14.

   * 'O_CLOEXEC' is not defined on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.6,

   * 'O_DIRECTORY', 'O_DSYNC', 'O_NOCTTY', 'O_NOFOLLOW', 'O_RSYNC',
     'O_SYNC', and 'O_TTY_INIT' are not defined on some platforms.
     Gnulib defines these macros to 0, which is generally safe.

   * 'O_NONBLOCK' is not defined on some platforms.  If the
     'nonblocking' module is in use, gnulib guarantees a working
     non-zero value; otherwise, the gnulib replacement is 0.

   * 'O_EXEC' and 'O_SEARCH' are not defined on some platforms.  Gnulib
     defines these macros to 'O_RDONLY', which is typically 0.  The
     'O_PATH' macro of GNU/Linux is not a suitable substitute, as fchmod
     fails with 'errno==EBADF' when invoked on a file descriptor that
     was opened with 'O_PATH'.

   * 'O_ACCMODE' is not defined on some platforms: MSVC 14.

   * The 'O_ACCMODE' mask mistakenly omits 'O_SEARCH' and 'O_EXEC' on

   * 'O_BINARY', 'O_TEXT' (not specified by POSIX, but essential for
     portability to native Windows platforms) are defined on some
     platforms but not on others.

   * 'O_CLOEXEC', 'O_NOFOLLOW', and 'O_TTY_INIT' are defined to values
     that are too large for an 'int' on some platforms: AIX 7.1 with XL
     C 12.1.

   * 'O_DIRECT', 'O_IGNORE_CTTY', 'O_NDELAY', 'O_NOATIME', 'O_NOLINK',
     'O_NOLINKS', and 'O_NOTRANS' (not specified by POSIX) are defined

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * The conversion from 'int' to 'long double' in incorrect on some
     platforms: glibc 2.7 on Linux/SPARC64.
   * The values of 'LDBL_*' macros are incorrect on some platforms: On
     OpenBSD 4.0 and MirBSD 10, they are the same as the values of the
     'DBL_*' macros, although 'long double' is a larger type than
     'double'.  On FreeBSD/x86 6.4, they represent the incorrect 53-bit
     precision assumptions in the compiler, not the real 64-bit
     precision at runtime.  On Linux/PowerPC with GCC 4.4, on AIX 7.1
     with GCC 4.2, and on IRIX 6.5, they don't reflect the "double
     double" representation of 'long double' correctly.

   Gnulib module: stdalign

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This header file is missing on many platforms: FreeBSD 6.4, NetBSD
     7.1, OpenBSD 6.7, Minix 3.3.0, AIX 7.1, HP-UX 11.31, IRIX 6.5,
     Solaris 11.3, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 9.0.
   * Clang 3.0's '<stdalign.h>' does not define 'alignof'/'_Alignof'.
   * The 'alignof' and '_Alignof' macros return too large values for the
     types 'double' and 'long long' in GCC 4.7.0.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * In ISO C11, the operand of 'alignof'/'_Alignof' must be a
     parenthesized type.  Recent versions of GCC support an extension in
     which the operand can also be a unary expression, as with 'sizeof'.
     The Gnulib substitute does not support this extension.
   * On most pre-C11 platforms, the operand of 'alignof'/'_Alignof'
     cannot be a structure type containing a flexible array member.
   * '_Alignas' and 'alignas' are not always supported; on platforms
     lacking support, the macro '__alignas_is_defined' is not defined.
     Supported compilers include GCC, IBM C, Sun C 5.9 and later, and
     MSVC 7.0 and later.
   * Some compilers do not support alignment via 'alignas'/'_Alignas' of
     'auto' variables (i.e., variables on the stack).  They diagnose and
     ignore the alignment: Sun C 5.11.
   * Some linkers do not support operands of '_Alignas'/'alignas' that
     are greater than 8: mingw.
   * Some compilers require the operand of '_Alignas'/'alignas' to be a
     single integer constant, not an expression: MSVC 7.0 through at
     least 10.0.
   * The Sun C 5.13 compiler sometimes mishandles the alignment of
     multiple external variables that are declared close together with
     '_Alignas'/'alignas'.  The Sun Studio Developer Bug Report Review
     Team assigned the internal review ID 2125432 (dated 2011-11-01) to
     this issue.  The bug appears to be fixed in Sun C 5.15, also known
     as Oracle Developer Studio 12.6.
   * '<stdalign.h>' must be #included before '_Alignas' and '_Alignof'
     can be used.
   * You cannot assume that '_Alignas' and '_Alignof' are reserved
     words; they might be macros.

   Gnulib module: stdbool

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This header file is missing on some platforms: AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11,
     IRIX 6.5.
   * This header file is not usable in C++ mode with the vendor compiler
     on Solaris 10.
   * Some compilers have bugs relating to 'bool'.
   * This header file defines 'true' incorrectly on some platforms:
     OpenBSD 4.7 with gcc 2.95.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * '_Bool' cannot be used before '<stdbool.h>' is included, or if the
     program is intended to be compiled by a C++ compiler.
   * You cannot assume that '_Bool' is a typedef; it might be a macro.
   * Bit-fields of type 'bool' are not supported.  Portable code should
     use 'unsigned int foo : 1;' rather than 'bool foo : 1;'.
   * Casts and automatic conversions to 'bool' don't test against the
     zero value or the null pointer, as they should.  Such casts should
     only be used if the value is known to be equal to 0 or 1.
   * You cannot assume that casting a floating point literal to 'bool'
     will result in a constant expression.
8.47 'stddef.h'

   Gnulib module: stddef

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * Some platforms fail to provide 'max_align_t', which was added in
     C11: NetBSD 8.0, Solaris 11.0, and others.

   * 'max_align_t' does not have the expected alignment on some
     platforms: NetBSD 8.0/x86.

   * Some old platforms fail to provide 'wchar_t'.

   * Some platforms provide a 'NULL' macro that cannot be used in
     arbitrary expressions: NetBSD 5.0

   * Some platforms provide a 'NULL' macro whose value does not have the
     size of a pointer: AIX 7.2 with xlc in 64-bit mode.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Some platforms provide an 'offsetof' macro that cannot be used in
     arbitrary expressions: Solaris 11.4 This problem can be worked
     around by parenthesizing the 'offsetof' expression in the unlikely
     case you use it with 'sizeof' or '[]'.
8.48 'stdint.h'
===============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdint.h.html>

   Gnulib module: stdint

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This header file is missing on some platforms: OpenBSD 3.8, AIX
     5.1, HP-UX 11.11, IRIX 6.5, MSVC 14.
   * This header file is very incomplete on some platforms.
   * The values of 'SIG_ATOMIC_MIN' and 'SIG_ATOMIC_MAX' are incorrect
     on some platforms: FreeBSD 6.2 / ia64.
   * The value of 'WINT_MAX' is incorrect on some platforms: mingw.
   * The values of 'INT8_MAX', 'UINT8_MAX' etc.  are not usable in
     preprocessor expressions on some platforms: HP-UX 11.23.
   * The values of 'INTPTR_MAX' and 'UINTPTR_MAX', although correctly
     defined in '<stdint.h>', are replaced by empty values when
     '<limits.h>' or '<inttypes.h>' gets included later on some
     platforms: Solaris 9 with GCC 4.5 or newer.
   * The macros 'WCHAR_MIN' and 'WCHAR_MAX' are not defined in
     '<stdint.h>' (only in '<wchar.h>') on some platforms: Dragonfly.
   * On some hosts that predate C++11, when using C++ one must define
     '__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS' to make visible the definitions of
     constant macros such as 'INTMAX_C', and one must define
     '__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS' to make visible the definitions of limit
     macros such as 'INTMAX_MAX'.
   * The macro 'SIZE_MAX' has the wrong type, albeit with the correct
     value: 32-bit glibc 2.24 (on s390 architecture), Mac OS X 10.7.
   * Macros like 'INTMAX_WIDTH' are not defined on some platforms: glibc
     2.24, NetBSD 9.0, many others.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * '{uint,int}_fast{8,16,32,64}_t' may not correspond to the fastest
     types available on the system.  Other '<stdint.h>' substitutes may
     define these types differently, so public header files should avoid
     these types.
   * Macros are used instead of typedefs.
   * Some C preprocessors mishandle constants that do not fit in 'long
     int'.  For example, as of 2007, Sun C mishandles '#if LLONG_MIN <
     0' on a platform with 32-bit 'long int' and 64-bit 'long long int'.
     Some older preprocessors mishandle constants ending in 'LL'.  To
     work around these problems, compute the value of expressions like
     'LONG_MAX < LLONG_MAX' at 'configure'-time rather than at
     '#if'-time.

   The 'stdint' module uses '#include_next'.  If you wish to install the
generated stdint.h file under another name, typically in order to be
able to use some of the types defined by stdint.h in your public header
file, you could use the following Makefile.am-snippet:


     BUILT_SOURCES += idn-int.h
     DISTCLEANFILES += idn-int.h
     nodist_include_HEADERS += idn-int.h

     idn-int.h:
     	if test -n "$(STDINT_H)"; then \
     		sed -e s/include_next/include/ gl/stdint.h > idn-int.h; \
     	else \
     		echo '#include <stdint.h>' > idn-int.h; \

   Portability problems fixed by the Gnulib module 'system-posix':
   * The macros 'WIFSIGNALED', 'WIFEXITED', 'WIFSTOPPED', 'WTERMSIG',
     'WEXITSTATUS', 'WNOHANG', 'WUNTRACED', 'WSTOPSIG' are not defined
     in this header file (only in '<sys/wait.h>') on some platforms:

   Gnulib module: stdnoreturn

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This header file is missing on many platforms: FreeBSD 6.4, NetBSD
     7.1, OpenBSD 6.7, Minix 3.3.0, AIX 7.1, HP-UX 11.31, IRIX 6.5,
     Solaris 11.3, Cygwin 2.9.0, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 9.0.
   * This file conflicts with some system header files, such as
     '<stdlib.h>' and '<process.h>', on some platforms: MSVC/clang.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * '<stdnoreturn.h>' should be #included before '_Noreturn' is used.
   * You cannot assume that '_Noreturn' is a reserved word; it might be
     a macro.
   * When the macro 'lint' is defined, standard headers define
     '_Noreturn' (and therefore 'noreturn') to be a macro that expands
     to the empty token sequence on some platforms: Cygwin 2.5.1,
     FreeBSD 10.3.
   * On Cygwin 1.7.30 and MSVC 14, 'noreturn' expands to the empty token
     sequence, to avoid problems with standard headers that use
     'noreturn' in combination with '__attribute__' or '__declspec'.
     Although the resulting code operates correctly, the compiler is not
     informed whether 'noreturn' functions do not return, so it may
     generate incorrect warnings at compile-time, or code that is
     slightly less optimized.  This problem does not occur with
     '_Noreturn'.
   * Circa 2012 bleeding-edge GCC with '-Werror=old-style-declaration'
     requires '_Noreturn' or 'noreturn' before the returned type in a
     declaration, and therefore rejects valid but unusually-worded
     declarations such as 'void _Noreturn foo (void);'.

   * The type 'mode_t' is not defined on some platforms: MSVC 14.
   * Some macros, such as 'S_IFMT' or 'S_IFIFO', are missing on some

   * The macros 'S_ISBLK', 'S_ISCHR', 'S_ISDIR', 'S_ISFIFO', 'S_ISLNK',
     'S_ISREG', 'S_ISSOCK' are broken on some platforms.
   * Some platforms define macros, such as 'S_ISDOOR', that are not
     defined on other platforms.
   * The functions 'lstat' and 'mkdir' are not declared on some
     platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * The macros 'UTIME_NOW' and 'UTIME_OMIT' are missing on some
     platforms.
   * On some platforms, 'struct stat' does not include 'st_atim',
     'st_mtim', or 'st_ctim' members.  Use the gnulib module 'stat-time'
     for accessors to portably get at subsecond resolution.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'sys_stat', together with
module 'windows-stat-inodes':
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), 'st_ino' is always 0.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * *Note time.h::, for general portability problems with the 'time_t'
     components of 'struct stat'.
   * The macro 'S_IFBLK' is missing on some platforms: MSVC 14.
   * On OpenVMS, 'st_ino' is an array of three 'ino_t' values, not a
     single value.
   * To partially work around the previous two problems, you can test
     for nonzero 'st_ino' and use the Gnulib 'same-inode' module to
     compare nonzero values.  For example, 'SAME_INODE (a, b)' is true
     if the 'struct stat' values 'a' and 'b' are known to represent the
     same file, '(a.st_ino && !SAME_INODE (a, b))' is true if they are
     known to represent different files, and '!a.st_ino' is true if it
     is not known whether they represent different files.
   * On some platforms, two different files may have the same 'st_dev'
     and 'st_ino' values, even when 'st_ino' is nonzero:
        * GNU/Linux NFS servers that export all local file systems as a
          single NFS file system, if a local 'st_dev' exceeds 255, or if
          a local 'st_ino' exceeds 16777215.
        * Network Appliance NFS servers in snapshot directories; see
          Network Appliance bug #195.
        * ClearCase MVFS; see bug id ATRia04618.
     One partial workaround is to compare other file metadata such as
     'st_mode' and 'st_mtime' to detect this bug, but this approach does
     not work on files whose metadata are being changed by other
     programs.
   * On some file systems, 'st_size' contains bogus information for
     symlinks; use the Gnulib module 'areadlink-with-size' for a better
     way to get symlink contents.

     with a file timestamp in the far future or past; on others, the
     functions silently return the low-order 32 bits of the correct
     timestamp.  These platforms will be obsolete when 32-bit 'time_t'
     rolls around, which will occur in 2038 for the typical case when

9 ISO C and POSIX Function Substitutes
**************************************

   This chapter describes which functions and function-like macros
specified by ISO C (including ISO TS 18661-1) or POSIX are substituted
by Gnulib, which portability pitfalls are fixed by Gnulib, and which
(known) portability problems are not worked around by Gnulib.

   The notation "Gnulib module: --" means that Gnulib does not provide a
module providing a substitute for the function.  When the list
"Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib" is empty, such a module is
not needed: No portability problems are known.  Otherwise, it indicates
that such a module would be useful but is not available: No one so far
found this function important enough to contribute a substitute for it.
If you need this particular function, you may write to
'<bug-gnulib at gnu dot org>'.

9.14 'accept'
=============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/accept.html>

   Gnulib module: accept

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), the descriptors returned
     by the 'accept' function cannot be used in calls to 'read',
     'write', and 'close'; you have to use 'recv', 'send', 'closesocket'
     in these cases instead.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), error codes from this
     function are not placed in 'errno', and 'WSAGetLastError' must be
     used instead.
   * On HP-UX 11, in 64-bit mode, when the macro
     '_HPUX_ALT_XOPEN_SOCKET_API' is not defined, this function behaves
     incorrectly because it is declared to take a pointer to a 64-bit
     wide 'socklen_t' entity but in fact considers it as a pointer to a
     32-bit wide 'unsigned int' entity.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Some platforms don't have a 'socklen_t' type; in this case this
     function's third argument type is 'int *'.
   * On some platforms, this function's third argument type is 'void *',
     not 'socklen_t *': Solaris 10.
9.15 'access'
=============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/access.html>

   Gnulib module: access

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function does not support the 'X_OK' mode on some platforms:
     MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function uses the effective id instead of the real id on some
     platforms: Cygwin 1.5.x.

   Other problems of this function:
   * There is an inherent race between calling this function and
     performing some action based on the results; you should think twice
     before trusting this function, especially in a set-uid or set-gid
     program.
   * This function does not have an option for not following symbolic

   * On native Windows, files whose basename does not contain a '.'
     cannot be executed through 'execlp' or 'execvp'.  Nevertheless,
     this function may return true for such files.
   * On Windows, different facilities for executing a program have
     different ways of finding an executable file, by trying various
     suffixes.  For example, 'execlp' and 'execvp' search for files with
     the suffixes '.com', '.exe', '.bat', '.cmd', when the file with the
     given file name does not exist.  Whereas 'cmd.exe' searches
     according to the 'PATHEXT' environment variable.  This function
     does not perform any search; it merely looks at the file with the
     given file name.

   Gnulib module: ctime

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * On native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC), this function works
     incorrectly when the environment variable 'TZ' has been set by
     Cygwin.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function may overflow its internal buffer if an invalid year
     is passed.
   * The 'ctime' function need not be reentrant, and consequently is not
     required to be thread safe.  Implementations of 'ctime' typically
     write the timestamp into static buffer.  If two threads call
     'ctime' at roughly the same time, you might end up with the wrong
     date in one of the threads, or some undefined string.  There is a
     re-entrant interface 'ctime_r'.
   * Native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC) support only a subset of
     time zones supported by GNU or specified by POSIX.  *Note tzset::.

   A more flexible function is 'strftime'.  However, note that it is
locale dependent.
9.179 'ctime_r'

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/ctime_r.html>

   Gnulib module: extensions

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function has an incompatible declaration on some platforms:
     Solaris 11.4 (when '_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS' is not defined).

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * This function may put more than 26 bytes into the argument buffer
     if an invalid year is passed.

   'ctime_r' takes a pre-allocated buffer and length of the buffer, and
returns 'NULL' on errors.  The input buffer should be at least 26 bytes
in size.  The output string is locale-independent.  However, years can
have more than 4 digits if 'time_t' is sufficiently wide, so the length
of the required output buffer is not easy to determine.  Increasing the
buffer size when 'ctime_r' returns 'NULL' is not necessarily sufficient.
The 'NULL' return value could mean some other error condition, which
will not go away by increasing the buffer size.

   A more flexible function is 'strftime'.  However, note that it is
locale dependent.

   Gnulib module: environ

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * POSIX does not require this variable to be declared, and it is
     indeed not declared on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD 6.0,
     NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 11.4.
   * On Mac OS X 10, this variable is not declared.  Up to Mac OS X
     10.4, one can use
          extern char **environ;
     to get the variable declared.  This does not work any more,
     however, in shared libraries on Mac OS X 10.13.  Here is a
     workaround: Instead, one can use
          #include <crt_externs.h>
          #define environ (*_NSGetEnviron())
     This works at all versions of Mac OS X.
   * On Cygwin in 64-bit mode, references to this variable cause a link
     error when the option '-Wl,--disable-auto-import' is in use.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The address of this variable is not a compile-time constant on some
     platforms: mingw.
   * Assigning NULL to 'environ' to clear all variables is not portable;
     better is to assign 'environ' to one-element array containing a
     NULL pointer.  That said, an empty environment is not portable
     either, as some systems may require particular environment
     variables (such as 'PATH') to be present in order to operate
     consistently.

     2010-11, Cygwin 1.7.1.  Note that the gnulib replacement code is
     functional but not atomic.

   * The 'F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC' action of this function does not set the
     'FD_CLOEXEC' flag on some platforms: NetBSD 9.0.

   * The 'F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC' action of this function sets the 'FD_CLOEXEC'
     flag on the wrong file descriptor on some platforms: Haiku.

   * The 'F_DUPFD' action of this function does not reject out-of-range
     targets properly on some platforms: AIX 7.1, Cygwin 1.5.x, Haiku.

   * The 'F_DUPFD' action of this function mistakenly clears
     'FD_CLOEXEC' on the source descriptor on some platforms: Haiku.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The replacement function does not support 'F_SETFD', 'F_GETFL',
     'F_SETFL', 'F_GETOWN', 'F_SETOWN', 'F_GETLK', 'F_SETLK', and
     'F_SETLKW' on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   * When a file does not support locking (such as on an NFS file system
     that does not support file locking), calls with 'F_SETLK' and
     'F_SETLKW' fail with 'errno' set to different values on different
     systems: 'EINVAL' on OpenIndiana (as suggested by the POSIX

   Gnulib module: fflush

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * 'fflush' followed by 'fseek' or 'fseeko', applied to an input
     stream, should have the effect of positioning the underlying file
     descriptor.  It doesn't do this on some platforms.
   * 'fflush' on an input stream changes the position of the stream to
     the end of the previous buffer, on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * 'fflush' on an input stream right after 'ungetc' does not discard
     the 'ungetc' buffer, on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD
     6.0, NetBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 6.7, Cygwin 1.5.25-10.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * 'fflush', 'ftell', 'ftello', 'fgetpos' behave incorrectly on input
     streams that are opened in 'O_TEXT' mode and whose contents
     contains Unix line terminators (LF), on some platforms: mingw, MSVC
     14.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not set
     'errno' upon failure.
   * This function crashes if the stream's file descriptor has already
     been closed, if 'MSVC_INVALID_PARAMETER_HANDLING' is
     'HAIRY_LIBRARY_HANDLING' or 'SANE_LIBRARY_HANDLING', on some
     platforms: MSVC 14.

   Gnulib module: stdio, nonblocking

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'stdio', together with
module 'nonblocking':
   * When reading from a non-blocking pipe whose buffer is empty, this
     function fails with 'errno' being set to 'EINVAL' instead of
     'EAGAIN' on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * C99 and POSIX.1-2001 and later require end-of-file to be sticky,
     that is, they require this function to act as if it reads
     end-of-file if 'feof' would return nonzero.  However, on some
     systems this function attempts to read from the underlying file
     descriptor even if the stream's end-of-file indicator is set.
     These systems include glibc and default Solaris.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not set
     'errno' upon failure.
   * This function crashes if the stream's file descriptor has already
     been closed, if 'MSVC_INVALID_PARAMETER_HANDLING' is

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * C99 and POSIX.1-2001 and later require end-of-file to be sticky,
     that is, they require this function to act as if it reads
     end-of-file if 'feof' would return nonzero.  However, on some
     systems this function attempts to read from the underlying file
     descriptor even if the stream's end-of-file indicator is set.
     These systems include glibc and default Solaris.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not set

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function crashes when invoked with invalid arguments on some
     platforms: MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, 'fstat' may not
     correctly report the size of files or block devices larger than 2
     GB. (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * On Linux/x86 and Linux/x86_64, applications compiled in 32-bit mode
     cannot access files that happen to have a 64-bit inode number.
     This can occur with file systems such as XFS (typically on large
     disks) and NFS. (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * On Solaris 11.4, when this function yields a timestamp with a
     nonpositive 'tv_sec' value, 'tv_nsec' might be in the range
     -1000000000..-1, representing a negative nanoseconds offset from
     'tv_sec'.
   * The 'st_atime', 'st_ctime', 'st_mtime' fields are affected by the
     current time zone and by the DST flag of the current time zone on
     some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14 (when the environment variable 'TZ'
     is set).

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * *Note sys/stat.h::, for general portability problems with 'struct

   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, 'fstatat' may not

   * On some platforms, 'fstatat(fd,"file/",buf,flag)' succeeds instead
     of failing with 'ENOTDIR'.  Solaris 9.
   * For symlinks, when the argument ends in a slash, some platforms
     don't dereference the argument: Solaris 9.
   * On Solaris 11.4, when this function yields a timestamp with a

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

     HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14,
     Android 4.3.  However, the replacement function may end up
     truncating timestamps to worse resolution than supported by the
     file system.
   * This function returns a bogus value instead of failing with
     'ENOSYS' on some platforms: Linux kernel 2.6.21.
   * When using 'UTIME_OMIT' or 'UTIME_NOW', some systems require the
     'tv_sec' argument to be 0, and don't necessarily handle all file
     permissions in the manner required by POSIX: Linux kernel 2.6.25.
   * When using 'UTIME_OMIT' for the modification time, but specifying
     an access time, some systems fail to update the change time: Linux
     kernel 2.6.32, Mac OS X 10.13, NetBSD 9.0, Solaris 11.1.
   * Passing 'AT_FDCWD' as the fd argument does not properly fail with
     'EBADF' on some systems: glibc 2.11, musl libc, Solaris 11.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Some platforms lack the ability to change the timestamps of a file
     descriptor, so the replacement can fail with 'ENOSYS'; the gnulib
     module 'utimens' provides a more reliable interface 'fdutimens'.
   * The mere act of using 'stat' modifies the access time of
     directories on some platforms, so 'utimensat' can only effectively
     change directory modification time: Cygwin 1.5.x.

   Gnulib module: stdio, nonblocking

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'stdio', together with
module 'nonblocking':
   * When reading from a non-blocking pipe whose buffer is empty, this
     function fails with 'errno' being set to 'EINVAL' instead of
     'EAGAIN' on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * C99 and POSIX.1-2001 and later require end-of-file to be sticky,
     that is, they require this function to act as if it reads
     end-of-file if 'feof' would return nonzero.  However, on some
     systems this function attempts to read from the underlying file
     descriptor even if the stream's end-of-file indicator is set.

   Gnulib module: getcwd or getcwd-lgpl

   Portability problems fixed by either Gnulib module 'getcwd' or
'getcwd-lgpl':
   * This function is declared in different header files (namely,
     '<io.h>' or '<direct.h>') on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On glibc and Solaris 11.4 platforms, 'getcwd (NULL, n)' allocates
     memory for the result.  On some other platforms, this call is not
     allowed.
   * On some platforms, the prototype for 'getcwd' uses 'int' instead of
     'size_t' for the size argument when using non-standard headers, and
     the declaration is missing from '<unistd.h>': mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On some platforms, 'getcwd (buf, 0)' crashes: MSVC 14.
   * On some platforms, 'getcwd (buf, 0)' fails with 'ERANGE' instead of
     the required 'EINVAL': mingw.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'getcwd':
   * This function does not handle long file names (greater than
     'PATH_MAX') correctly on some platforms: glibc on Linux 2.4.20, Mac
     OS X 10.13, FreeBSD 6.4, NetBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 4.9, AIX 7.1.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * When using 'getcwd(NULL, nonzero)', some platforms, such as glibc
     or cygwin, allocate exactly 'nonzero' bytes and fail with 'ERANGE'
     if it was not big enough, while other platforms, such as FreeBSD,
     mingw, or MSVC 14, ignore the size argument and allocate whatever
     size is necessary.  If this call succeeds, an application cannot
     portably access beyond the string length of the result.

   Gnulib module: getopt-posix or getopt-gnu

   The module 'getopt-gnu' has support for "long options" and for
"options that take optional arguments".  Compared to the API defined by
POSIX, it adds a header file '<getopt.h>' and a function 'getopt_long'.

   Portability problems fixed by either Gnulib module 'getopt-posix' or
'getopt-gnu':
   * This function is missing on some platforms: MSVC 14.
   * The value of 'optind' after a missing required argument is wrong on
     some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, AIX 7.1, mingw.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'getopt-gnu':
   * The function 'getopt' does not support the '+' flag in the options
     string on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, AIX 5.2, HP-UX 11, IRIX
     6.5, Solaris 11 2010-11.
   * The function 'getopt' does not obey the combination of '+' and ':'
     flags in the options string on some platforms: glibc 2.11.
   * The function 'getopt' does not obey the '-' flag in the options
     string when 'POSIXLY_CORRECT' is set on some platforms: Cygwin
     1.7.0.
   * The function 'getopt' does not support options with optional
     arguments on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, OpenBSD 4.0, AIX 5.2,
     HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 11 2010-11, Cygwin 1.5.x.
   * The function 'getopt_long' is missing on some platforms: AIX 5.1,
     HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 9, MSVC 14.
   * The function 'getopt_long' does not support abbreviated long
     options where all disambiguations are equivalent on some platforms:
     OpenBSD 5.0.
   * The function 'getopt_long_only' is missing on some platforms:
     FreeBSD 5.2.1, NetBSD 9.0, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 9,
     mingw, MSVC 14.
   * This function crashes if the option string includes 'W;' on some
     platforms: glibc 2.14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The default behavior of the glibc implementation of 'getopt' allows
     mixing option and non-option arguments on the command line in any
     order.  Other implementations, such as the one in Cygwin, enforce
     strict POSIX compliance: they require that the option arguments
     precede the non-option arguments.  This is something to watch out
     in your program's testsuite.
   * The glibc implementation allows a complete reset of the
     environment, including re-checking for 'POSIXLY_CORRECT', by
     setting 'optind' to 0.  Several BSD implementations provide
     'optreset', causing a reset by setting it non-zero, although it
     does not necessarily re-read 'POSIXLY_CORRECT'.  Solaris 'getopt'
     does not support either reset method, but does not maintain state
     that needs the extra level of reset.
   * On some platforms, this function does not set the stream error
     indicator on attempts to write to a read-only stream: glibc 2.13,
     Cygwin 1.7.9.

=============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/iconv.html>

   Gnulib module: iconv

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * GNU libiconv is not found if installed in '$PREFIX/lib'.
   * Failures are not distinguishable from successful returns on some
     platforms: AIX 5.1, Solaris 10.
   * A buffer overrun can occur on some platforms: AIX 6.1..7.1.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD
     6.0, OpenBSD 6.7, Minix 3.1.8, Cygwin 2.9, mingw, MSVC 14, Android
     8.1, when GNU libiconv is not installed.
   * This function was not correctly implemented in glibc versions
     before 2.2.
   * When 'iconv' encounters an input character that is valid but that
     cannot be converted to the output character set, glibc's and GNU
     libiconv's 'iconv' stop the conversion.  Some other implementations
     put an implementation-defined character into the output buffer.
     Gnulib provides higher-level facilities 'striconv' and 'striconveh'
     (wrappers around 'iconv') that deal with conversion errors in a
     platform independent way.
   * This function returns a positive return value, instead of zero,
     when converting from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 on HP-UX 11.

9.444 'iconv_open'
==================

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/iconv_open.html>

   Gnulib module: iconv, iconv_open, iconv_open-utf

   Portability problems fixed by either Gnulib module 'iconv' or
'iconv_open':
   * GNU libiconv is not found if installed in '$PREFIX/lib'.
   * No converter from EUC-JP to UTF-8 is provided on some platforms:
     HP-UX 11.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'iconv_open':
   * This function recognizes only non-standard aliases for many
     encodings (not the IANA registered encoding names) on many
     platforms: AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 11 2010-11, z/OS.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'iconv_open-utf':
   * This function does not support the encodings UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE,
     UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE on many platforms: AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD
     6.0, OpenBSD 6.7, Minix 3.1.8, Cygwin 2.9, mingw, MSVC 14, Android
     8.1, when GNU libiconv is not installed.
   * For some encodings A and B, this function cannot convert directly
     from A to B, although an indirect conversion from A through UTF-8
     to B is possible.  This occurs on some platforms: Solaris 11
     2010-11.  Gnulib provides a higher-level facility 'striconveh' (a
     wrapper around 'iconv') that deals with this problem.
   * The set of supported encodings and conversions is system dependent.

support the multibyte characters that occur in strings in locales with

'c_isxdigit'

     'c-ctype'.

'iswxdigit'
     This function operates in a locale dependent way, on wide
     characters.  In order to use it, you first have to convert from
     multibyte to wide characters, using the 'mbrtowc' function.  It is
     provided by the Gnulib module 'wctype'.

'mb_isxdigit'
     This function operates in a locale dependent way, on multibyte
     characters.  It is provided by the Gnulib module 'mbchar'.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The effects of this call are system and compiler optimization
     dependent, since it restores the contents of register-allocated
     variables but not the contents of stack-allocated variables.
   * When longjumping out of a signal handler that was being executed on
     an alternate stack (installed through 'sigaltstack'), on FreeBSD,
     NetBSD, OpenBSD, you need to clear the 'SS_ONSTACK' flag in the
     'stack_t' structure managed by the kernel.

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/lseek.html>

   Gnulib module: lseek

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is declared in a different header file (namely,
     '<io.h>') on some platforms: MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, 'lseek' does not work
     correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * This function mistakenly succeeds on pipes on some platforms:
     mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * POSIX does not specify which file descriptors support seeking and
     which don't.  In practice, regular files and block devices support
     seeking, and ttys, pipes, and most character devices don't support
     it.
   * When the third argument is invalid, POSIX says that 'lseek' should
     set 'errno' to 'EINVAL' and return -1, but in this situation a
     'SIGSYS' signal is raised on some platforms: IRIX 6.5.
   * Some systems do not support 'SEEK_DATA' and 'SEEK_HOLE': AIX,
     HP-UX, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, OpenBSD.
9.586 'lstat'
=============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/lstat.html>

   Gnulib module: lstat

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, 'lstat' may not
     correctly report the size of files or block devices larger than 2
     GB. (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * On Linux/x86 and Linux/x86_64, applications compiled in 32-bit mode
     cannot access files that happen to have a 64-bit inode number.
     This can occur with file systems such as XFS (typically on large
     disks) and NFS. (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * For symlinks, when the argument ends in a slash, some platforms
     don't dereference the argument: Solaris 9.
   * On some platforms, 'lstat("file/",buf)' succeeds instead of failing
     with 'ENOTDIR'.  Mac OS X 10.13, Solaris 9.
   * On Solaris 11.4, when this function yields a timestamp with a
     nonpositive 'tv_sec' value, 'tv_nsec' might be in the range
     -1000000000..-1, representing a negative nanoseconds offset from
     'tv_sec'.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), symlinks are not
     supported, so 'lstat' does not exist.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * *Note sys/stat.h::, for general portability problems with 'struct
     stat'.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * Upon failure, the function does not set 'errno' to 'ENOMEM' on some
     platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * 'malloc (0)' always returns a NULL pointer on some platforms: AIX
     5.1.

   Extension: Gnulib provides a module 'malloc-gnu' that substitutes a
'malloc' implementation that behaves more like the glibc implementation,
regarding the result of 'malloc (0)'.

   * This function is missing on some platforms: Minix 3.1.8, HP-UX
     11.00, IRIX 6.5, mingw.
   * In the C or POSIX locales, this function can return '(size_t) -1'
     and set 'errno' to 'EILSEQ': glibc 2.23.
   * This function returns 0 instead of '(size_t) -2' when the input is
     empty: glibc 2.19.
   * This function returns '(size_t) -1' instead of '(size_t) -2' when
     the input is empty: AIX 5.1.
   * This function does not put the state into non-initial state when
     parsing an incomplete multibyte character on some platforms: AIX
     5.1.
   * This function returns the total number of bytes that make up the
     multibyte character, not the number of bytes that were needed to
     complete the multibyte character, on some platforms: HP-UX 11.11,
     Solaris 11 2010-11.
   * This function may not return 0 when parsing the NUL character on

   * This function stores a wide character when when parsing an
     incomplete multibyte character on some platforms: MSVC 14.
   * This function returns the total number of bytes that make up the
     multibyte character, not the number of bytes that were needed to
     complete the multibyte character, on some platforms: HP-UX 11.11,
     Solaris 11 2010-11, mingw, possibly MSVC 14.
   * This function may not return 0 when parsing the NUL character on
     some platforms: Solaris 9.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * On Windows and 32-bit AIX platforms, 'wchar_t' is a 16-bit type and
     therefore cannot accommodate all Unicode characters.  However, the
     ISO C11 function 'mbrtoc32', provided by Gnulib module 'mbrtoc32',
     operates on 32-bit wide characters and therefore does not have this

   * This function produces invalid wide characters on some platforms:
     Solaris 11.4.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * On Windows and 32-bit AIX platforms, 'wchar_t' is a 16-bit type and
     therefore cannot accommodate all Unicode characters.  However, the
     Gnulib function 'mbsnrtoc32s', provided by Gnulib module
     'mbsnrtoc32s', operates on 32-bit wide characters and therefore
     does not have this limitation.
   * The specification is not clear about whether this function should
     update the conversion state when the first argument (the
     destination pointer) is NULL. The glibc, Mac OS X, FreeBSD
     implementations do update the state in this case.  For portability,
     when passing a NULL destination argument, it is best to pass a
     pointer to a temporary copy of the conversion state.

9.609 'mknod'
=============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/mknod.html>

   Gnulib module: mknod

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function requires super-user privileges to create a fifo:
     FreeBSD 7.2, NetBSD 8.0, OpenBSD 6.7.
   * This function mishandles trailing slash on some platforms: FreeBSD
     7.2, Solaris 9.
   * This function is missing on some platforms; however, the
     replacement always fails with 'ENOSYS': mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Use of this function for anything except fifos is not portable,
     generally requiring super-user privileges and knowledge of
     supported device numbers.
   * If the argument exists and is a directory, this function fails with
     'EISDIR' instead of the correct 'EEXIST': HP-UX 11.11.

     10.13, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, AIX 5.1,
     HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14,
     Android 4.4.  But the replacement function is not safe to be used
     in libraries and is not multithread-safe.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The gnulib replacement function always fails with 'ENOSYS' on some
     platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

===============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/mkstemp.html>

   Gnulib module: mkstemp

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, 'mkstemp' may not work
     correctly to create files larger than 2 GB.  (Cf.
     'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * On some older platforms, 'mkstemp' can create a world or group
     writable or readable file, if you haven't set the process umask to
     077.  This is a security risk.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

   Gnulib module: mktime

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * On native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC), this function works
     incorrectly when the environment variable 'TZ' has been set by
     Cygwin.
   * 'mktime' may go into an endless loop on some platforms.
   * 'mktime' may occasionally return wrong results on some platforms.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC) support only a subset of
     time zones supported by GNU or specified by POSIX.  *Note tzset::.

   Gnulib module: --

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may not
     work correctly across the entire data range of files larger than 2
     GB. The fix is to use the 'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' macro.
   * To get anonymous memory, on some platforms, you can use the flags
     'MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE' and '-1' instead of a file
     descriptor; on others you have to use a read-only file descriptor
     of '/dev/zero'.
   * On HP-UX, passing a non-NULL first argument, as a hint for the
     address (even without 'MAP_FIXED', often causes 'mmap' to fail.
     Better pass NULL in this case.
   * On HP-UX, 'MAP_FIXED' basically never works.  On other platforms,
     it depends on the circumstances whether memory can be returned at a
     given address.

     6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.7.x, mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, 'open' may not work
     correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * This function does not fail when the file name argument ends in a
     slash and (without the slash) names a nonexistent file or a file
     that is not a directory, on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD
     7.2, AIX 7.1, HP-UX 11.00, Solaris 9.
   * This function does not support the 'O_NONBLOCK' flag when it is
     defined by the gnulib module 'nonblocking' on some platforms:
     mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does usually
     not recognize the '/dev/null' filename.

   Portability problems fixed by the Gnulib module 'fchdir':
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function fails to
     open a read-only descriptor for directories.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The Gnulib replacement for 'O_CLOEXEC' is not atomic, and so is not
     safe in the presence of multiple threads or signal handlers.
   * 'open ("symlink", O_NOFOLLOW ...)' fails with 'errno' set to
     'EMLINK' instead of the POSIX-required 'ELOOP' on some platforms:
     FreeBSD 10.1.
   * 'open ("symlink", O_NOFOLLOW ...)' fails with 'errno' set to
     'EFTYPE' instead of the POSIX-required 'ELOOP' on some platforms:
     NetBSD 6.1.
   * On Windows, this function returns a file handle in 'O_TEXT' mode by
     default; this means that it translates ''\n'' to CR/LF by default.
     Use the 'O_BINARY' flag if you need reliable binary I/O.

     that is not a directory, on some platforms: Solaris 9.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The Gnulib replacement for 'O_CLOEXEC' is not atomic, and so is not

<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html>

   Gnulib module: pipe-posix

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function crashes rather than failing with 'EMFILE' if no
     resources are left on some platforms: Cygwin 1.7.9.
9.687 'poll'
============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/poll.html>

   Gnulib module: poll

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14, HP
     NonStop.
   * This function doesn't work on special files like '/dev/null' and
     ttys like '/dev/tty' on some platforms: AIX 5.3.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Under Windows, when passing a pipe, Gnulib's 'poll' replacement
     might return 0 even before the timeout has passed.  Programs using
     it with pipes can thus busy wait.

   * Under HP NonStop, file descriptors other than sockets do not
     support POLLHUP; they will return a "readable" status instead.
9.688 'popen'
=============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/popen.html>

   Gnulib module: popen

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: MSVC 14.
   * Some platforms start the child with closed stdin or stdout if the
     standard descriptors were closed in the parent: Cygwin 1.5.x.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * On native Windows platforms, this functions terminates the current
     process with exit code 127 if the environment variable 'COMSPEC' is
     not set.
   * Some platforms mistakenly set the close-on-exec bit, then if it is
     cleared by the application, the platform then leaks file
     descriptors from earlier 'popen' calls into subsequent 'popen'
     children: Cygwin 1.5.x.
9.689 'posix_fadvise'
=====================

   POSIX specification:

     IRIX 6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 4.4.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may not
     work correctly across the entire data range of files larger than 2
     GB. The fix is to use the 'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' macro.
9.690 'posix_fallocate'
=======================

     6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 4.4.
   * POSIX specifies that EINVAL should be returned when the file system
     doesn't support the allocation operation directly.  glibc however
     emulates the file system allocation with writes where unsupported,
     and apps have depended on that long term implementation.  This is
     both inefficient, and as of glibc 2.21 at least, buggy on certain
     NFS setups.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may not
     work correctly across the entire data range of files larger than 2
     GB. The fix is to use the 'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' macro.

9.693 'posix_memalign'
======================

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_memalign.html>

   Gnulib module: posix_memalign

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function produces misaligned results on some platforms:
     OpenBSD 6.1.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD

     6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 4.1.

   The Gnulib module 'aligned-malloc' provides functions for allocating
and freeing blocks of suitably aligned memory.

   The Gnulib module 'pagealign_alloc' provides a similar API for
allocating and freeing blocks of memory aligned on a system page
boundary.
9.694 'posix_openpt'
====================

   POSIX specification:

     mingw, MSVC 14, Android 4.4.  However, the replacement may fail
     with 'ENOSYS' or 'ENOENT' on some platforms.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

   Note that when using this function to open the master side of a
pseudo-terminal, you still need platform dependent code to open the
corresponding slave side.  The Gnulib module 'openpty' provides an
easy-to-use API that does both at once.
9.695 'posix_spawn'
===================

   POSIX specification:

     9, Cygwin 1.7.x, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 8.1.
   * When this function fails, it causes the stdio buffer contents to be
     output twice on some platforms: AIX 6.1.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function does not work on some platforms: AIX 6.1 (under
     particular circumstances), mingw.

   The Gnulib modules 'posix_spawn_file_actions_addchdir' and
'posix_spawn_file_actions_addfchdir' provide additional actions, that
consist in changing the current directory of the child process before
starting the specified program.
9.696 'posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose'

     incorrect result on some platforms: AIX 5.2, Solaris 11.4, mingw,
     MSVC 14.
   * This function does not support the 'a' and 'A' directives on some
     platforms: glibc-2.3.6, Mac OS X 10.5, NetBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 4.0, AIX
     5.2, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 11.4, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC

     arguments in an arbitrary order, such as '"%2$s"', on some
     platforms: NetBSD 3.0, mingw, MSVC 14.
   * This function doesn't support the ''' flag on some platforms:
     NetBSD 3.0, Cygwin 1.5.24, mingw, MSVC 14.
   * This function does not round the argument of the 'a' directive
     correctly on some platforms: Mac OS X 10.12, FreeBSD 6.1.
   * printf '"%010f"' of NaN and Infinity yields an incorrect result
     (padded with zeroes, or wrong capitalization) on some platforms:

     10.
   * This function can crash in out-of-memory conditions on some
     platforms: FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'stdio' or
'printf-posix', together with module 'nonblocking':
   * When writing to a non-blocking pipe whose buffer is full, this
     function fails with 'errno' being set to 'ENOSPC' instead of
     'EAGAIN' on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'stdio' or
'printf-posix', together with module 'sigpipe':
   * When writing to a pipe with no readers, this function fails,
     instead of obeying the current 'SIGPIPE' handler, on some
     platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The '%m' directive is not portable, use '%s' mapped to an argument
     of 'strerror(errno)' (or a version of 'strerror_r') instead.
   * Formatting noncanonical 'long double' numbers produces
     nonmeaningful results on some platforms: glibc and others, on x86,
     x86_64, IA-64 CPUs.
   * When formatting an integer with grouping flag, this function
     inserts thousands separators even in the "C" locale on some
     platforms: NetBSD 5.1.
   * Attempting to write to a read-only stream fails with 'EOF' but does
     not set the error flag for 'ferror' on some platforms: glibc 2.13,
     cygwin 1.7.9.

   * On some platforms, this function fails to detect invalid fds with
     EBADF, but only if they lie beyond the current maximum open fd:
     FreeBSD 8.2.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * When the SIGMASK argument is nonnull on platforms that do not
     natively support this function, race conditions are possible when
     its gnulib implementation temporarily modifies the signal mask, and
     the behavior is unspecified in a multi-threaded process.

   Gnulib module: read, stdio, nonblocking

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'read':

     '<io.h>') on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * This function crashes when invoked with invalid arguments on some
     platforms: MSVC 14.

   POSIX specification:

   Gnulib module: readdir

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may not
     work correctly on huge directories larger than 2 GB.  Also, on
     platforms where 'ino_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may report
     inode numbers incorrectly.  This can occur with file systems such
     as XFS (typically on large disks) and NFS.  (Cf.
     'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Although POSIX places no restrictions on 'd_ino' values, some older
     systems are rumored to return 'd_ino' values equal to zero for
     directory entries that do not really exist.  Although Gnulib
     formerly attempted to cater to these older systems, this caused
     misbehavior on standard systems and so Gnulib does not attempt to
     cater to them any more.  If you know of any problems caused by
     this, please send a bug report.
9.899 'readdir_r'
=================

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/readdir_r.html>

   Gnulib module: extensions

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is planned to be removed from POSIX and to be
     deprecated in glibc.  Portable applications should use 'readdir'.
   * This function has an incompatible declaration on some platforms:
     Solaris 11.4 (when '_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS' is not defined).

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: Minix 3.1.8, mingw,
     MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may not
     work correctly on huge directories larger than 2 GB.  Also, on
     platforms where 'ino_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may report
     inode numbers incorrectly.  This can occur with file systems such
     as XFS (typically on large disks) and NFS.  The fix is to use the
     'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' macro.
9.900 'readlink'
================

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/readlink.html>

   Gnulib module: readlink

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * Some platforms mistakenly succeed on 'readlink("link/",buf,len)':
     FreeBSD 7.2, Solaris 9, Mac OS X 10.10.
   * On some platforms, 'readlink' returns 'int' instead of 'ssize_t':
     glibc 2.4, FreeBSD 6.0, OpenBSD 6.7, Cygwin 1.5.x, AIX 7.1.
   * This function is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * When 'readlink' is called on a directory: In the case of NFS
     mounted directories, Cygwin sets 'errno' to 'ENOENT' or 'EIO'
     instead of 'EINVAL'.  To avoid this problem, check for a directory
     before calling 'readlink'.
   * When 'readlink' is called on a file that is not a symbolic link:
     IRIX may set 'errno' to 'ENXIO' instead of 'EINVAL'.  Cygwin may
     set errno to 'EACCES' instead of 'EINVAL'.
   * Symlink contents do not always have a trailing null byte, and there
     is no indication if symlink contents were truncated if the return
     value matches the length.  Furthermore, AIX 5.1 and HP-UX 11 set
     'errno' to 'ERANGE' rather than returning truncated contents, and
     Linux sets 'errno' to 'EINVAL' if the requested length is zero.
     Use the gnulib module 'areadlink' for improved ability to read
     symlink contents.
9.901 'readlinkat'
==================

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/readlinkat.html>

     HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14,
     Android 4.4.  But the replacement function is not safe to be used
     in libraries and is not multithread-safe.
   * Some platforms mistakenly succeed on 'readlink("link/",buf,len)':
     Mac OS X 10.10.
   * On some platforms, 'readlinkat' returns 'int' instead of 'ssize_t':
     AIX 7.1.
   * 
   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function always fails on platforms that don't support
     symlinks: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * When 'readlink' is called on a directory: In the case of NFS
     mounted directories, Cygwin sets 'errno' to 'ENOENT' or 'EIO'
     instead of 'EINVAL'.  To avoid this problem, check for a directory
     before calling 'readlink'.
   * When 'readlink' is called on a file that is not a symbolic link:
     IRIX may set 'errno' to 'ENXIO' instead of 'EINVAL'.  Cygwin may

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/realloc.html>

   Gnulib module: realloc-posix

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * Upon failure, the function does not set 'errno' to 'ENOMEM' on some
     platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * It is not portable to call 'realloc' with a size of 0.  With a NULL
     pointer argument, this is the same ambiguity as 'malloc (0)' on
     whether a unique zero-size object is created.  With a non-NULL
     pointer argument, C99 requires that if 'realloc (p, 0)' returns
     'NULL' then 'p' is still valid.  Among implementations that obey
     C99, behavior varies on whether 'realloc (p, 0)' always fails and
     leaves 'p' valid, or usually succeeds and returns a unique
     zero-size object; either way, a program not suspecting these
     semantics will leak memory (either the still-valid 'p', or the
     non-NULL return value).  Meanwhile, several implementations violate
     C99, by always calling 'free (p)' but returning NULL: glibc, Cygwin

   Extension: Gnulib provides a module 'realloc-gnu' that substitutes a
'realloc' implementation that behaves more like the glibc
implementation.
9.904 'realpath'
================

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/realpath.html>

   Gnulib module: canonicalize-lgpl

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * This function does not allow for a NULL 'resolved' parameter on
     some platforms: Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD 6.4, OpenBSD 4.4, Solaris
     10.
   * This function does not always return an absolute path on some
     platforms: Solaris 10.
   * This function fails to detect trailing slashes on non-directories
     on some platforms: glibc 2.3.5.
   * This function fails to recognize non-directories followed '..' on
     some platforms: cygwin.
   * This function misbehaves on consecutive slashes on some platforms:
     AIX 7.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function does not allow to determine the required size of
     output buffer; the use of a non-NULL 'resolved' buffer is
     non-portable, since PATH_MAX, if it is defined, is nothing more
     than a guess.

   * On HP-UX 11, in 64-bit mode, when the macro
     '_HPUX_ALT_XOPEN_SOCKET_API' is not defined, this function behaves
     incorrectly because it is declared to take a pointer to a 64-bit
     wide 'socklen_t' entity but in fact considers it as a pointer to a
     32-bit wide 'unsigned int' entity.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function does not allow trailing slashes when creating a
     destination directory, as in 'rename("dir","new/")': NetBSD 1.6.
   * This function does not reject trailing slashes on the destination

   * This function does not reject trailing slashes on symlinks to
     non-directories on some platforms, as in
     'rename("link-to-file/","f")': FreeBSD 7.2.
   * This function ignores trailing slashes on symlinks on some
     platforms, such that 'rename("link/","new")' corrupts 'link':
     Solaris 9.
   * This function incorrectly reduces the link count when comparing two
     spellings of a hard link on some platforms: NetBSD 1.6, Cygwin
     1.5.x.
   * This function will not always replace an existing destination on
     some platforms: Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14.  However, the
     replacement is not atomic for directories, and may end up losing
     the empty destination if the source could not be renamed.
   * This function mistakenly allows names ending in '.' or '..' on some
     platforms: Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14.
   * This function does not reject attempts to rename existing
     directories and non-directories onto one another on some platforms:
     Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * POSIX requires that 'rename("symlink-to-dir/","dir2")' rename 'dir'
     and leave 'symlink-to-dir' dangling; likewise, it requires that
     'rename("dir","dangling/")' rename 'dir' so that 'dangling' is no
     longer a dangling symlink.  This behavior is counter-intuitive, so
     on some systems, 'rename' fails with 'ENOTDIR' if either argument
     is a symlink with a trailing slash: glibc, OpenBSD, Cygwin 1.7.
   * POSIX requires that 'rename' do nothing and return 0 if the source
     and destination are hard links to the same file.  This behavior is
     counterintuitive, and on some systems 'renameat' is a no-op in this
     way only if the source and destination identify the same directory
     entry.  On these systems, for example, although renaming './f' to
     'f' is a no-op, renaming 'f' to 'g' deletes 'f' when 'f' and 'g'
     are hard links to the same file: NetBSD 7.0.
   * After renaming a non-empty directory over an existing empty
     directory, the old directory name is still visible through the
     'stat' function for 30 seconds after the rename, on NFS file
     systems, on some platforms: Linux 2.6.18.
   * This function will not rename a source that is currently opened by
     any process: mingw, MSVC 14.

     HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14.  But the
     replacement function is not safe to be used in libraries and is not
     multithread-safe.
   * This function is declared in '<unistd.h>', not in '<stdio.h>', on
     some platforms: NetBSD 7.0, Solaris 11.4.
   * This function is declared in '<sys/stat.h>', not in '<stdio.h>', on

===============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/scandir.html>

   Gnulib module: scandir

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: Minix 3.1.8, Solaris 9,
     mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may not
     work correctly on huge directories larger than 2 GB.  Also, on
     platforms where 'ino_t' is a 32-bit type, this function may report
     inode numbers incorrectly.  (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The fourth parameter of this function is declared as 'int (*)
     (const void *, const void *)' on some platforms: glibc 2.3.6, Mac
     OS X 10.13, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 7.1, OpenBSD 6.7.
   * The fourth parameter of this function is declared as 'int (*) (void

   Gnulib module: stdio, nonblocking

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'stdio', together with
module 'nonblocking':
   * When reading from a non-blocking pipe whose buffer is empty, this
     function fails with 'errno' being set to 'EINVAL' instead of
     'EAGAIN' on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * C99 and POSIX.1-2001 and later require end-of-file to be sticky,
     that is, they require this function to act as if it reads
     end-of-file if 'feof' would return nonzero.  However, on some
     systems this function attempts to read from the underlying file
     descriptor even if the stream's end-of-file indicator is set.
     These systems include glibc and default Solaris.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not set
     'errno' upon failure.
   * On Windows, this function doesn't support the 'hh', 'll', 'j', 't',
     'z' size specifiers.

9.952 'select'
==============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/select.html>

   Gnulib module: select

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), 'select' can only be
     called on descriptors created by the 'socket' function, not on
     regular file descriptors.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), error codes from this
     function are not placed in 'errno', and 'WSAGetLastError' must be
     used instead.
   * On some platforms, this function fails to detect invalid fds with
     EBADF, but only if they lie beyond the current maximum open fd:
     FreeBSD 8.2.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * When you call 'select' with a timeout, some implementations modify
     the timeout parameter so that upon return from the function, it
     contains the amount of time not slept.  Other implementations leave
     the timeout parameter unmodified.
   * Under Windows, when passing a pipe, Gnulib's 'select' replacement
     might return 0 even before the timeout has passed.  Programs using
     it with pipes can thus busy wait.
   * On Linux, when some file descriptor refers to a regular file,
     'select' may fail, setting 'errno' to 'EBADF'.

   Gnulib module: setlocale, setlocale-null

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'setlocale':
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), 'setlocale(CATEGORY,NULL)'
     ignores the environment variables 'LC_ALL', 'CATEGORY', and 'LANG'.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin) and Cygwin 1.5.x,
     'setlocale(LC_ALL,NAME)' succeeds and sets the LC_CTYPE category to
     'C' when it does not support the encoding, instead of failing.
   * On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), 'setlocale' understands
     different locale names, that are not based on ISO 639 language
     names and ISO 3166 country names.
   * On Android 4.3, which which doesn't have locales, the 'setlocale'
     function always fails.  The replacement, however, supports only the
     locale names '"C"' and '"POSIX"'.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module 'setlocale' or
'setlocale-null':
   * Invocations of 'setlocale (..., NULL)' are not multithread-safe on
     some platforms: musl libc, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, AIX,
     Haiku, Cygwin.  To make these invocations multithread-safe, you
     need the Gnulib module 'setlocale', or you need to change the code
     to invoke 'setlocale_null' or 'setlocale_null_r' instead.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * On Cygwin 1.5.x, which doesn't have locales,
     'setlocale(LC_ALL,NULL)' always returns '"C"'.
   * On Cygwin 1.7.0, only the charset portion of a locale designation
     is honored.
   * On OpenBSD, 'setlocale(LC_ALL,"")' will only update categories that
     are deemed appropriate for the 'LC_ALL' environment value, even if
     there are other categories set to different values in the
     environment.  In addition any value is accepted for 'LC_CTYPE', and
     so NULL is never returned to indicate a failure to set locale.  To
     verify category values, each category must be set individually with
     'setlocale(LC_COLLATE,"")' etc.

   * Support for SA_RESETHAND is missing on some platforms: NonStop.

   * Support for SA_RESTART is missing on some platforms: mingw, MSVC

   * The symbolic value 'SIG_IGN' for the 'SIGCHLD' signal is equivalent

          {
            while (waitpid (-1, NULL, WNOHANG) > 0)
              ;
          }
     except that 'SIG_IGN' for 'SIGCHLD' has the effect that the
     children execution times are not accounted in the 'times' function.
     On some platforms (BSD? SystemV? Linux?), you need to use the
     'sigaction' flag 'SA_NOCLDWAIT' in order to obtain this behavior.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function crashes when invoked with invalid arguments on some
     platforms: MSVC 14.
   * On System V platforms, when the signal is triggered, the kernel
     uninstalls the handler (i.e. resets the signal's action to SIG_DFL)
     before invoking the handler.  This opens the door to race
     conditions: undesired things happen if the signal is triggered
     twice and the signal handler was not quick enough reinstalling
     itself as a handler.  On BSD platforms and glibc platforms, on the
     other hand, when the signal is triggered, the kernel blocks the
     signal before invoking the handler.  This is saner, but POSIX still
     allows either behavior.  To avoid this problem, use 'sigaction'
     instead of 'signal'.

9.1054 'stat'
=============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/stat.html>

   Gnulib module: stat

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * On platforms where 'off_t' is a 32-bit type, 'stat' may not
     correctly report the size of files or block devices larger than 2
     GB. (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * On Linux/x86 and Linux/x86_64, applications compiled in 32-bit mode
     cannot access files that happen to have a 64-bit inode number.
     This can occur with file systems such as XFS (typically on large
     disks) and NFS. (Cf.  'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'.)
   * The 'st_atime', 'st_ctime', 'st_mtime' fields are affected by the
     current time zone and by the DST flag of the current time zone on
     some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14 (when the environment variable 'TZ'
     is set).
   * On MSVC 14, this function fails with error 'ENOENT' on files such
     as 'C:\pagefile.sys' and on directories such as 'C:\System Volume
     Information'.
   * On some platforms, 'stat("link-to-file/",buf)' succeeds instead of
     failing with 'ENOTDIR'.  Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD 7.2, AIX 7.1,
     Solaris 9, mingw64.
   * On some platforms, 'stat(".",buf)' and 'stat("./",buf)' give
     different results: mingw, MSVC 14.
   * On Solaris 11.4, when this function yields a timestamp with a
     nonpositive 'tv_sec' value, 'tv_nsec' might be in the range
     -1000000000..-1, representing a negative nanoseconds offset from
     'tv_sec'.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * *Note sys/stat.h::, for general portability problems with 'struct
     stat'.
   * Cygwin's 'stat' function sometimes sets 'errno' to 'EACCES' when
     'ENOENT' would be more appropriate.
   * Because of the definition of 'struct stat', it is not possible to
     portably replace 'stat' via an object-like macro.  Therefore,
     expressions such as '(islnk ? lstat : stat) (name, buf)' are not
     portable, and should instead be written 'islnk ? lstat (name, buf)
     : stat (name, buf)'.
9.1055 'statvfs'

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: OpenBSD 3.8, mingw,
     MSVC 14, Android 4.3.
   * This function can hang if it stats all preceding entries in
     /proc/mounts, and any of those file systems are hard-mounted and
     not available.  This affects Linux < 2.6.36.
   * On platforms where 'f_blocks' in 'struct statvfs' is a 32-bit
     value, this function may not work correctly on files systems larger
     than 4 TiB.  The fix is to use the 'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' macro.  This
     affects glibc/Hurd, HP-UX 11, Solaris.

as 'statvfs'.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * stderr is created in 32-bit mode instead of 64-bit mode: Cygwin

     Cygwin 1.5.21 or newer.  Another is to use the gnulib 'ftello'
     module and do ftello(stderr).
   * POSIX states that a setuid application can guarantee that fd 2 is
     open, but some systems guarantee this even for non-setuid programs.
     If an application is executed with fd 2 closed, use of 'stderr' can
     affect an unrelated file that happened to be assigned to fd 2.  The

   * When the value is not in range or the buffer is too small, this
     function fails to leave a NUL-terminated string in the buffer on
     some platforms: glibc 2.13, FreeBSD 8.2, Solaris 10.

   Note: This function was designed for the use-case of filling a
fixed-size record with a string, before writing it to a file.  This
function is *not* appropriate for copying a string into a bounded memory
area, because you have no guarantee that the result will be
NUL-terminated.  Even if you add the NUL byte at the end yourself, this
function is inefficient (as it spends time clearing unused memory) and
will allow silent truncation to occur, which is not a good behavior for

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Some systems allow a superuser to unlink directories, even though
     this can cause file system corruption.  The error given if a
     process is not permitted to unlink directories varies across
     implementations; it is not always the POSIX value of 'EPERM'.
     Meanwhile, if a process has the ability to unlink directories,
     POSIX requires that 'unlink("symlink-to-dir/")' remove 'dir' and
     leave 'symlink-to-dir' dangling; this behavior is
     counter-intuitive.  The gnulib module 'unlinkdir' can help
     determine whether code must be cautious of unlinking directories.
   * Removing an open file is non-portable: On Unix this allows the
     programs that have the file already open to continue working with

   * This function is declared in '<fcntl.h>', not in '<unistd.h>', on

   * Some systems mistakenly succeed on 'unlinkat(fd,"file/",flag)':
     GNU/Hurd, Solaris 9.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * When 'unlinkat(fd,name,AT_REMOVEDIR)' fails because the specified
     directory is not empty, the 'errno' value is system dependent.
   * POSIX requires that 'unlinkdir(fd,"link-to-empty/",AT_REMOVEDIR)'
     remove 'empty' and leave 'link-to-empty' as a dangling symlink.
     This is counter-intuitive, so some systems fail with 'ENOTDIR'

     platforms: FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 1.6, OpenBSD 3.8.
   * On some platforms, this function does not fail with 'EINVAL' when

   * This function removes only the first value association for the
     given environment variable, not all of them, on some platforms:
     Solaris 11.4, Haiku.

<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/utimensat.html>

   Gnulib module: utimensat

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: glibc 2.5, Mac OS X
     10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, AIX 5.1,
     HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14,
     Android 3.0.  However, the replacement function may end up
     truncating timestamps to worse resolution than supported by the
     file system.  Furthermore, the replacement function is not safe to
     be used in libraries and is not multithread-safe.
   * This function returns a bogus value instead of failing with
     'ENOSYS' on some platforms: Linux kernel 2.6.21.
   * This function fails with 'ENOSYS' if passed the flag
     'AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW' on a regular file: Linux kernel 2.6.22.
   * When using 'UTIME_OMIT' or 'UTIME_NOW', some systems require the
     'tv_sec' argument to be 0, and don't necessarily handle all file
     permissions in the manner required by POSIX: Linux kernel 2.6.25.
   * When using 'UTIME_OMIT' for the modification time, but specifying
     an access time, some systems fail to update the change time: Linux
     kernel 2.6.32, Mac OS X 10.13, NetBSD 9.0, Solaris 11.1.
   * Out-of-range values of 'tv_nsec' do not lead to a failure on some
     platforms: Linux kernel 2.6.22.19 on hppa.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * On some platforms, timestamps of symbolic links cannot be modified,
     so the replacement fails with 'ENOSYS' if passed the flag
     'AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW' on a symlink.
   * The mere act of using 'lstat' modifies the access time of symlinks
     on some platforms, so 'utimensat' with 'AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW' can
     only effectively change modification time: Cygwin.
   * The mere act of using 'stat' modifies the access time of
     directories on some platforms, so 'utimensat' can only effectively
     change directory modification time: Cygwin 1.5.x.

   The gnulib module 'fdutimensat' provides a similar interface.
9.1206 'utimes'
===============

   Gnulib module: --

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: Minix 3.1.8, mingw,
     MSVC 14.
   * On some platforms, this function mis-handles trailing slash:
     FreeBSD 7.2, Solaris 9.
   * This function cannot set full timestamp resolution.  In particular,
     some platforms incorrectly round rather than truncate.  Use
     'utimensat(AT_FDCWD,file,times,0)', or the gnulib module 'utimens',
     instead.
   * On some platforms, 'utimes (file, NULL)' fails to set the file's
     timestamp to the current time: glibc 2.3.3.
   * On some platforms, 'utimes' failed on read-only files when 'utime'
     worked fine.  glibc 2.2.5.
   * On OS/2, this function cannot set the timestamp to earlier than the
     year 1980 in local time.
   * On OS/2, this function cannot set the timestamp to an odd number of
     seconds.
   * On OS/2, this function does not work on an opened file.

   Extension: Gnulib provides a module 'utimens' that works around these
problems and allows to set the time with nanosecond resolution (as far
as supported by the file system).
9.1207 'va_arg'
===============

   POSIX specification:
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/va_arg.html>

   Gnulib module: --

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * The second argument of 'va_arg' must be a type that is invariant
     under the "default argument promotions" (ISO C 99 6.5.2.2 paragraph
     6).  This means that the following are not valid here:
     'float'
          Use 'double' instead.
     'bool'
          Use 'int' instead.
     Integer types smaller than 'int'.
          Use 'int' or 'unsigned int' instead.

     This is a portability problem because you don't know the width of
     some abstract types like 'uid_t', 'gid_t', 'mode_t'.  So, instead
     of
          mode = va_arg (ap, mode_t);
     you have to write
          mode = (sizeof (mode_t) < sizeof (int)
                  ? va_arg (ap, int)
                  : va_arg (ap, mode_t));

     6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX
     6.5, Solaris 11.3, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14.

   * This function does not support precisions in the 'ls' directive
     correctly on some platforms: Solaris 11.4.

   * This function does not support precisions larger than 512 or 1024
     in integer, floating-point and pointer output on some platforms:

     of 'strerror(errno)' (or a version of 'strerror_r') instead.
   * Formatting noncanonical 'long double' numbers produces
     nonmeaningful results on some platforms: glibc and others, on x86,
     x86_64, IA-64 CPUs.
   * When formatting an integer with grouping flag, this function
     inserts thousands separators even in the "C" locale on some
     platforms: NetBSD 5.1.
   * On some platforms, this function does not set 'errno' or the stream
     error indicator on attempts to write to a read-only stream: Cygwin
     1.7.9.

appropriate for copying a wide string into a bounded memory area,
because you have no guarantee that the result will be null-terminated.
Even if you add the null character at the end yourself, this function is
inefficient (as it spends time clearing unused memory) and will allow
silent truncation to occur, which is not a good behavior for GNU

10 Past POSIX Function Substitutes
**********************************

   This chapter describes which functions and function-like macros
specified by older versions of POSIX are substituted by Gnulib, which
portability pitfalls are fixed by Gnulib, and which (known) portability
problems are not worked around by Gnulib.

   The notation "Gnulib module: --" means that Gnulib does not provide a
module providing a substitute for the function.  When the list
"Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib" is empty, such a module is
not needed: No portability problems are known.  Otherwise, it indicates
that such a module would be useful but is not available: No one so far
found this function important enough to contribute a substitute for it.
If you need this particular function, you may write to
'<bug-gnulib at gnu dot org>'.

12 Glibc Function Substitutes
*****************************

   This chapter describes which functions and function-like macros
provided as extensions by at least GNU libc are also supported by
Gnulib, which portability pitfalls are fixed by Gnulib, and which
(known) portability problems are not worked around by Gnulib.

   The notation "Gnulib module: --" means that Gnulib does not provide a
module providing a substitute for the function.  When the list
"Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib" is empty, such a module is
not needed: No portability problems are known.  Otherwise, it indicates
that such a module would be useful but is not available: No one so far
found this function important enough to contribute a substitute for it.
If you need this particular function, you may write to
'<bug-gnulib at gnu dot org>'.

   This list of functions is sorted according to the header that
declares them.

------------------------

   Documentation:
   * *note Erasing Sensitive Data: (libc)Erasing Sensitive Data,
   * man explicit_bzero.

   Gnulib module: explicit_bzero

   The 'explicit_bzero' function is an approximation to what is needed,
and does not suffice in general to erase information.  Although calling
'explicit_bzero' should clear the memory in question, the information
that was in memory may still be available elsewhere on the machine.
Proper implementation of information erasure requires support from
levels below C code.

   Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
   * This function is missing on some platforms: glibc 2.24, FreeBSD 10,
     NetBSD 7.1, OpenBSD 5.4, macOS 10.12, Solaris 11.4, Android 9.0,
     and many other systems.

   Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
   * Although the module's implementation should clear the memory on
     platforms compatible with GCC and on platforms using traditional
     linkers, it may not clear the memory on non-GCC platforms that use
     whole-program optimization.

     libc 5.0.9
   * This function can trigger false positives for long periodic needles
     on some platforms: glibc 2.12, Cygwin 1.7.7.

   * This function returns incorrect values in some cases, such as when
     given an empty needle: glibc <= 2.0, Solaris 11.4, Cygwin 1.5.x.

   Performance problems fixed by Gnulib module 'memmem':
   * This function has quadratic instead of linear worst-case complexity
     on some platforms: glibc 2.8, FreeBSD 6.2, NetBSD 9.0, AIX 5.1,

Although this function is intended to produce random data, the data's
security properties may not be appropriate for your application.  For
example, identical "random" data streams might be produced by rebooted
virtual machines.  If this is of concern you may need to use additional
techniques such as hedging.(1)

   Related modules include 'getrandom', which has a more-flexible but
more-complex API, and 'crypto/gc-random', which is likely a better match
for code already using the other 'crypto' APIs.

13 Native Windows Support
*************************

   There are three ways to create binaries that run on Microsoft
Windows:
   * Native binaries, built using the MinGW tool chain.
   * Native binaries, built using the MSVC (MS Visual C/C++) tool chain.
   * Binaries for the Cygwin environment.

   This chapter deals with the MinGW and MSVC platforms, commonly called
"native Windows" platforms.  Cygwin, on the other hand, is close enough
to POSIX that it can be treated like any other Unix-like platform.

13.1 Libtool and Windows
========================

   If you want it to be possible to compile your program for a native
Windows platform and you use Libtool, you need to use the 'win32-dll'
option of 'LT_INIT'.  In other words, put:

     LT_INIT([win32-dll])

   in your 'configure.ac'.  This sets the correct names for the
'OBJDUMP', 'DLLTOOL', and 'AS' tools for the build.

   If you are building a library, you will also need to pass
'-no-undefined' to make sure Libtool produces a DLL for your library.
From a 'Makefile.am':

     libgsasl_la_LDFLAGS += -no-undefined

13.2 Large File Support
=======================

   The module provides support for files larger than 2 GB. To this
effect, it ensures that 'off_t' is a 64-bit integer type at least on the
following platforms: glibc, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, AIX,
HP-UX, IRIX, Solaris, Cygwin, mingw, MSVC.

13.3 Inode numbers on Windows
=============================

   The module 'windows-stat-inodes' ensures that, on native Windows
platforms, 'struct stat' contains 'st_dev', 'st_ino' fields that are
able to distinguish different inodes.

   Note: Such values can only be provided for most files on the file
system.  For a few files (such as inaccessible files), 'st_dev' and
'st_ino' are set to 0.  Therefore, you should test whether 'st_dev != 0
&& st_ino != 0', before going to make inferences based on the file
identity based on 'st_dev' and 'st_ino'.

13.4 Precise file timestamps on Windows
=======================================

   The module 'windows-stat-timespec' ensures that, on native Windows
platforms, 'struct stat' contains 'st_atim', 'st_mtim', 'st_ctim' fields
of type 'struct timespec', providing 100 ns resolution for the
timestamps of files.

   Note: On some types of file systems, the timestamp resolution is
limited by the file system.  For example, on FAT file systems, 'st_mtim'
only has a resolution of 2 seconds.  For more details, see
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SysInfo/file-times>.

13.5 Avoiding the year 2038 problem
===================================

   The "year 2038 problem" denotes unpredictable behaviour of programs
that will likely occur in the year 2038, for programs that use a 32-bit
'time_t' type.  See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem>
for details.

   The gnulib module 'year2038' attempts to avoid this problem, by
ensuring that 'time_t' is a 64-bit type.

13.6 Windows sockets
====================

   One of the portability problems for native Windows are sockets and
networking functions.

13.6.1 Getaddrinfo and WINVER
-----------------------------

   This was written for the 'getaddrinfo' module, but may be applicable
to other functions too.

   The 'getaddrinfo' function exists in 'ws2tcpip.h' and '-lws2_32' on
Windows XP.  The function declaration is present if 'WINVER >= 0x0501'.
Windows 2000 does not have 'getaddrinfo' in its 'WS2_32.DLL'.

   Thus, if you want to assume Windows XP or later, you can add
'AC_DEFINE([WINVER], [0x0501])' to avoid compiling the (partial)
'getaddrinfo' implementation.

   If you want to support Windows 2000, don't do anything.  The
replacement function will open 'WS2_32.DLL' during run-time to see if
there is a 'getaddrinfo' function available, and use it when available.

13.7 Native Windows Support without MSVC Support
================================================

   If your package does not desire to have MSVC support, that is, if
MinGW shall be the only native Windows platform that you wish to get
support for from Gnulib, and you wish to minimize the number of files
imported from Gnulib accordingly, you can do so by passing the options
'--avoid=msvc-inval --avoid=msvc-nothrow' to 'gnulib-tool'.

13.8 Visual Studio Compatibility
================================

   The 'lib-msvc-compat' module detects whether the linker supports
'--output-def' when building a library.  That parameter is used to
generate a DEF file for a shared library (DLL). DEF files are useful for
developers that use Visual Studio to develop programs that links to your
library.  See the GNU LD manual for more information.

   There are other ways to create a DEF file, but we believe they are
all sub-optimal to using '--output-def' during the build process.  The
variants we have considered include:

   * Use DUMPBIN /EXPORTS. This is explained in
     <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dash-exports>.
     The tool does not generate DEF files directly, so its output needs
     to be post processed manually:
          $ { echo EXPORTS; \
              dumpbin /EXPORTS libfoo-0.dll | tail -n+20 | awk '{ print $4 }'; \
            } > libfoo-0.def
          $ lib /def:libfoo-0.def

   * Use IMPDEF. There is a tool called IMPDEF that can generate DEF
     files.  However, it is not part of a standard Visual Studio
     installation.  Further, it is documented as being an unreliable
     process.

   * Use DLLTOOL. The dlltool is part of the MinGW suite, and thus not
     part of a standard Visual Studio installation.  The documentation
     for the IMPDEF tool claims that DLLTOOL is the wrong tool for this
     job.  Finally, DLLTOOL does not generate DEF files directly, so it
     requires post-processing of the output.

   If you are using libtool to build your shared library, here is how to
use this module.  Import 'lib-msvc-compat' to your project, and then add
the following lines to the 'Makefile.am' that builds the library:

     if HAVE_LD_OUTPUT_DEF
     libfoo_la_LDFLAGS += -Wl,--output-def,libfoo-$(DLL_VERSION).def
     defexecdir = $(bindir)
     defexec_DATA = libfoo-$(DLL_VERSION).def
     DISTCLEANFILES += $(defexec_DATA)
     endif

   The 'DLL_VERSION' variable needs to be defined.  It should be the
shared library version number used in the DLL filename.  For Windows
targets you compute this value from the values you pass to Libtool's
'-version-info'.  Assuming you have variables 'LT_CURRENT' and 'LT_AGE'
defined for the 'CURRENT' and 'AGE' libtool version integers, you
compute 'DLL_VERSION' as follows:

     DLL_VERSION=`expr ${LT_CURRENT} - ${LT_AGE}`
     AC_SUBST(DLL_VERSION)

14 Multithreading
*****************

   Multithreading is a programming paradigm.  In a multithreaded
program, multiple threads execute concurrently (or quasi concurrently)
at different places in the program.

   There are three motivations for using multithreading in a program:
   * Exploiting CPU hardware with multiple execution units.  Nowadays,
     many CPUs have 2 to 8 execution cores in a single chip.
     Additionally, often multiple CPU chips are combined in a single
     package.  Thus, some CPU packages support 64 or 96 simultaneous
     threads of execution.
   * Simplifying program architecture.  When a program has to read from
     different file descriptors, network sockets, or event channels at
     the same time, the classical single-threaded architecture is to
     have a main loop which uses 'select' or 'poll' on all the
     descriptors and then dispatches according to from which descriptor
     input arrived.  In a multi-threaded program, you allocate one
     thread for each descriptor, and these threads can be programmed and
     managed independently.
   * Offloading work from signal handlers.  A signal handler is not
     allowed to call 'malloc'; therefore you are very limited in what
     you can do in a signal handler.  But a signal handler can notify a
     thread, and the thread can then do the appropriate processing, as
     complex as it needs to be.

   A multithreading API offers
   * Primitives for creating threads, for waiting until threads are
     terminated, and for reaping their results.
   * Primitives through which different threads can operate on the same
     data or use some data structures for communicating between the
     threads.  These are called "mutexes" or "locks".
   * Primitives for executing a certain (initialization) code at most
     once.
   * Primitives for notifying one or more other threads.  These are
     called wait queues or "condition variables".
   * Primitives for allowing different threads to have different values
     for a variable.  Such a variable is said to reside in "thread-local
     storage" or "thread-specific storage".
   * Primitives for relinquishing control for some time and letting
     other threads go.

   Note: Programs that achieve multithreading through OpenMP (cf.  the
gnulib module 'openmp') don't create and manage their threads
themselves.  Nevertheless, they need to use mutexes/locks in many cases.

14.1 The three multithreading APIs
==================================

   Three multithreading APIs are available to Gnulib users:
   * POSIX multithreading,
   * ISO C multithreading,
   * Gnulib multithreading.

   They are supported on all platforms that have multithreading in one
form or the other.  Currently, these are all platforms supported by
Gnulib, except for Minix.

   The main differences are:
   * The exit code of a thread is a pointer in the POSIX and Gnulib
     APIs, but only an 'int' in the ISO C API.
   * The POSIX API has additional facilities for detaching threads,
     setting the priority of a thread, assigning a thread to a certain
     set of processors, and much more.
   * In the POSIX and ISO C APIs, most functions have a return code, and
     you are supposed to check the return code; even locking and
     unlocking a lock can fail.  In the Gnulib API, many functions don't
     have a return code; if they cannot complete, the program aborts.
     This sounds harsh, but such aborts have not been reported in 12
     years.
   * In the ISO C API, the initialization of a statically allocated lock
     is clumsy: You have to initialize it through a once-only function.

14.2 Choosing the right multithreading API
==========================================

   Here are guidelines for determining which multithreading API is best
for your code.

   In programs that use advanced POSIX APIs, such as spin locks,
detached threads ('pthread_detach'), signal blocking
('pthread_sigmask'), priorities ('pthread_setschedparam'), processor
affinity ('pthread_setaffinity_np'), it is best to use the POSIX API.
This is because you cannot convert an ISO C 'thrd_t' or a Gnulib
'gl_thread_t' to a POSIX 'pthread_t'.

   In code that is shared with glibc, it is best to use the POSIX API as
well.

   In libraries, it is best to use the Gnulib API. This is because it
gives the person who builds the library an option
'--enable-threads={isoc,posix,windows}', that determines on which native
multithreading API of the platform to rely.  In other words, with this
choice, you can minimize the amount of glue code that your library needs
to contain.

   In the other cases, the POSIX API and the Gnulib API are equally well
suited.

   The ISO C API is never the best choice, as of this writing (2020).

14.3 The POSIX multithreading API
=================================

   The POSIX multithreading API is documented in POSIX
<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/>.

   To make use of POSIX multithreading, even on platforms that don't
support it natively (most prominently, native Windows), use the
following Gnulib modules:
Purpose                                                Module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
For thread creation and management:                    'pthread-thread'
For simple and recursive locks:                        'pthread-mutex'
For read-write locks:                                  'pthread-rwlock'
For once-only execution:                               'pthread-once'
For "condition variables" (wait queues):               'pthread-cond'
For thread-local storage:                              'pthread-tss'
For relinquishing control:                             'sched_yield'
For spin locks:                                        'pthread-spin'

   There is also a convenience module named 'pthread' which depends on
all of these (except 'sched_yield'); so you don't need to enumerate
these modules one by one.

14.4 The ISO C multithreading API
=================================

   The ISO C multithreading API is documented in ISO C 11
<http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf>.

   To make use of ISO C multithreading, even on platforms that don't
support it or have severe bugs, use the following Gnulib modules:
Purpose                                                       Module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
For thread creation and management:                           'thrd'
For simple locks, recursive locks, and read-write locks:      'mtx'
For once-only execution:                                      'mtx'
For "condition variables" (wait queues):                      'cnd'
For thread-local storage:                                     'tss'

   There is also a convenience module named 'threads' which depends on
all of these; so you don't need to enumerate these modules one by one.

14.5 The Gnulib multithreading API
==================================

   The Gnulib multithreading API is documented in the respective include
files:
   * '<glthread/thread.h>'
   * '<glthread/lock.h>'
   * '<glthread/cond.h>'
   * '<glthread/tls.h>'
   * '<glthread/yield.h>'

   To make use of Gnulib multithreading, use the following Gnulib
modules:
Purpose                                                       Module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
For thread creation and management:                           'thread'
For simple locks, recursive locks, and read-write locks:      'lock'
For once-only execution:                                      'lock'
For "condition variables" (wait queues):                      'cond'
For thread-local storage:                                     'tls'
For relinquishing control:                                    'yield'

   The Gnulib multithreading supports a configure option
'--enable-threads={isoc,posix,windows}', that chooses the underlying
thread implementation.  Currently (2020):
   * '--enable-threads=posix' is supported and is the best choice on all
     platforms except for native Windows.  It may also work, to a
     limited extent, on mingw with the 'winpthreads' library, but is not
     recommended there.
   * '--enable-threads=windows' is supported and is the best choice on
     native Windows platforms (mingw and MSVC).
   * '--enable-threads=isoc' is supported on all platforms that have the
     ISO C multithreading API. However, '--enable-threads=posix' is
     always a better choice.

14.6 Optimizations of multithreaded code
========================================

   Despite all the optimizations of multithreading primitives that have
been implemented over the years -- from atomic operations in hardware
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap), over futexes
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futex) and restartable sequences
(https://www.efficios.com/blog/2019/02/08/linux-restartable-sequences/)
in the Linux kernel, to lock elision [1]
(https://lwn.net/Articles/534758/) [2]
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Elision-Tunables.html))
-- single-threaded programs can still profit performance-wise from the
assertion that they are single-threaded.

   Gnulib defines four facilities that help optimizing for the
single-threaded case.

   * The Gnulib multithreading API, when used on glibc <= 2.32 and *BSD
     systems, uses weak symbols to detect whether the program is linked
     with 'libpthread'.  If not, the program has no way to create
     additional threads and must therefore be single-threaded.  This
     optimization applies to all the Gnulib multithreading API (locks,
     thread-local storage, and more).
   * The 'thread-optim' module, on glibc >= 2.32 systems, allows your
     code to skip locking between threads (regardless which of the three
     multithreading APIs you use).  You need extra code for this:
     include the '"thread-optim.h"' header file, and use the macro
     'gl_multithreaded' like this:
          bool mt = gl_multithreaded ();
          if (mt) gl_lock_lock (some_lock);
          ...
          if (mt) gl_lock_unlock (some_lock);
   * The 'unlocked-io' module is applicable only if all the programs in
     your package are single-threaded.  It optimizes the operations on
     'FILE' streams.  You need extra code for this: include the
     '"unlocked-io.h"' header file.  Some Gnulib modules that do
     operations on 'FILE' streams have these preparations already
     included.
   * You may define the C macro 'GNULIB_WCHAR_SINGLE', if all the
     programs in your package are single-threaded and won't change the
     locale after it has been initialized.  This macro optimizes the
     functions 'mbrtowc' and 'wcwidth'.

15 Particular Modules
*********************

15.1 alloca
===========

   The 'alloca' module provides for a function 'alloca' which allocates
memory on the stack, where the system allows it.  A memory block
allocated with 'alloca' exists only until the function that calls
'alloca' returns or exits abruptly.

   There are a few systems where this is not possible: HP-UX systems,
and some other platforms when the C++ compiler is used.  On these
platforms the alloca module provides a 'malloc' based emulation.  This
emulation will not free a memory block immediately when the calling
function returns, but rather will wait until the next 'alloca' call from
a function with the same or a shorter stack length.  Thus, in some
cases, a few memory blocks will be kept although they are not needed any
more.

   The user can '#include <alloca.h>' and use 'alloca' on all platforms.
Note that the '#include <alloca.h>' must be the first one after the
autoconf-generated 'config.h', for AIX 3 compatibility.  Thanks to IBM
for this nice restriction!

   Note that GCC 3.1 and 3.2 can _inline_ functions that call 'alloca'.
When this happens, the memory blocks allocated with 'alloca' will not be
freed until _the end of the calling function_.  If this calling function
runs a loop calling the function that uses 'alloca', the program easily
gets a stack overflow and crashes.  To protect against this compiler
behaviour, you can mark the function that uses 'alloca' with the
following attribute:

     #ifdef __GNUC__
     __attribute__ ((__noinline__))
     #endif

   An alternative to this module is the 'alloca-opt' module.

15.2 alloca-opt
===============

   The 'alloca-opt' module provides for a function 'alloca' which
allocates memory on the stack, where the system allows it.  A memory
block allocated with 'alloca' exists only until the function that calls
'alloca' returns or exits abruptly.

   There are a few systems where this is not possible: HP-UX systems,
and some other platforms when the C++ compiler is used.  On these
platforms the 'alloca-opt' module provides no replacement, just a
preprocessor macro HAVE_ALLOCA.

   The user can '#include <alloca.h>' on all platforms, and use 'alloca'
on those platforms where the preprocessor macro HAVE_ALLOCA evaluates to
true.  If HAVE_ALLOCA is false, the code should use a heap-based memory
allocation based on 'malloc' or (in C++) 'new'.  Note that the '#include
<alloca.h>' must be the first one after the autoconf-generated
'config.h', for AIX 3 compatibility.  Thanks to IBM for this nice
restriction!

   Note that GCC 3.1 and 3.2 can _inline_ functions that call 'alloca'.
When this happens, the memory blocks allocated with 'alloca' will not be
freed until _the end of the calling function_.  If this calling function
runs a loop calling the function that uses 'alloca', the program easily
gets a stack overflow and crashes.  To protect against this compiler
behaviour, you can mark the function that uses 'alloca' with the
following attribute:

     #ifdef __GNUC__
     __attribute__ ((__noinline__))
     #endif

15.3 Safe Allocation Macros
===========================

   The standard C library malloc/realloc/calloc/free APIs are prone to a
number of common coding errors.  The 'safe-alloc' module provides macros
that make it easier to avoid many of them.  It still uses the standard C
allocation functions behind the scenes.

   Some of the memory allocation mistakes that are commonly made are

   * passing the incorrect number of bytes to 'malloc', especially when
     allocating an array,
   * fail to check the return value of 'malloc' and 'realloc' for
     errors,
   * forget to fully initialize memory just allocated with 'malloc',
   * duplicate calls to 'free' by forgetting to set the pointer variable
     to 'NULL',
   * leaking memory in calls to 'realloc' when that call fails.

   The 'safe-alloc' module addresses these problems in the following
way:

   * It defines macros that wrap around the standard C allocation
     functions.  That makes it possible to use the compiler's knowledge
     of the size of objects for allocation; it also allows setting
     pointers passed in as arguments when appropriate.
   * It uses return values only for a success/failure error condition
     flag, and annotates them with GCC's '__warn_unused_result__'
     attribute.
   * It uses 'calloc' instead of 'malloc'.

 -- Macro: int ALLOC (ptr)
     Allocate 'sizeof(*ptr)' bytes of memory and store the address of
     allocated memory in 'ptr'.  Fill the newly allocated memory with
     zeros.

     Returns -1 on failure, 0 on success.

 -- Macro: int ALLOC_N (ptr, count)
     Allocate an array of 'count' elements, each 'sizeof(*ptr)' bytes
     long, and store the address of allocated memory in 'ptr'.  Fill the
     newly allocated memory with zeros.

     Returns -1 on failure, 0 on success.

 -- Macro: int ALLOC_N_UNINITIALIZED (ptr, count)
     Allocate an array of 'count' elements, each 'sizeof(*ptr)' bytes
     long, and store the address of allocated memory in 'ptr'.  The
     allocated memory is not initialized.

     Returns -1 on failure, 0 on success.

 -- Macro: int REALLOC_N (ptr, count)
     Reallocate the memory pointed to by 'ptr' to be big enough to hold
     at least 'count' elements, each 'sizeof(*ptr)' bytes long, and
     store the address of allocated memory in 'ptr'.  If reallocation
     fails, the 'ptr' variable is not modified.

     Returns -1 on failure, 0 on success.

 -- Macro: void FREE (ptr)
     Free the memory stored in 'ptr' and set 'ptr' to 'NULL'.

15.4 Attributes
===============

   This module provides a header file 'attribute.h' that defines macros
related to C and C++ attributes and the GCC '__attribute__' keyword.

   Here is an example of its use:

     #include <attribute.h>

     extern char *crypt (char const *, char const *)
       ATTRIBUTE_NOTHROW ATTRIBUTE_LEAF ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL ((1, 2));

'ATTRIBUTE_NOTHROW' expands to '__attribute__ ((__nothrow__))' if the
compiler is a recent-enough GCC or GCC-like compiler, and to nothing
otherwise.  Similarly for 'ATTRIBUTE_LEAF'.  'ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL ((1,
2))' expands to '__attribute__ ((__nonnull__ (1, 2)))' if the compiler
is recent-enough GCC, and to nothing otherwise.

   Most of these attribute names begin with 'ATTRIBUTE_'.  A few do not,
because they are part of C2X and their names are not likely to clash
with other macro names.  These macros are 'DEPRECATED', 'FALLTHROUGH',
'MAYBE_UNUSED', and 'NODISCARD', which can be defined to
'[[deprecated]]' etc. on C2X platforms.

15.5 Compile-time Assertions
============================

   This module provides a header file 'verify.h' that defines macros
related to compile-time verification.

   Two of these macros are 'verify (V)' and 'verify_expr (V, EXPR)'.
Both accept an integer constant expression argument V and verify that it
is nonzero.  If not, a compile-time error results.

   These two macros implement compile-time tests, as opposed to the
standard 'assert' macro which supports only runtime tests.  Since the
tests occur at compile-time, they are more reliable, and they require no
runtime overhead.

   'verify (V);' is a declaration; it can occur outside of functions.
In contrast, 'verify_expr (V, EXPR)' is an expression that returns the
value of EXPR; it can be used in macros that expand to expressions.  If
EXPR is an integer constant expression, then 'verify_expr (V, EXPR)' is
also an integer constant expression.  Although EXPR and 'verify_expr (V,
EXPR)' are guaranteed to have the same side effects and value and type
(after integer promotion), they need not have the same type if EXPR's
type is an integer that is narrower than 'int' or 'unsigned int'.

   V should be an integer constant expression in the sense of the C
standard.  Its leaf operands should be integer, enumeration, or
character constants; or 'sizeof' expressions that return constants; or
floating constants that are the immediate operands of casts.  Outside a
'sizeof' subexpression, V should not contain any assignments, function
calls, comma operators, casts to non-integer types, or subexpressions
whose values are outside the representable ranges for their types.  If V
is not an integer constant expression, then a compiler might reject a
usage like 'verify (V);' even when V is nonzero.

   Although the standard 'assert' macro is a runtime test, C2X specifies
a builtin '_Static_assert (V)', its 'assert.h' header has a similar
macro named 'static_assert', and C++17 has a similar 'static_assert'
builtin.  These builtins and macros differ from 'verify' in two major
ways.  First, they can also be used within a 'struct' or 'union'
specifier, in place of an ordinary member declaration.  Second, they
allow the programmer to specify, as an optional second argument, a
compile-time diagnostic as a string literal.  If your program is not
intended to be portable to compilers that lack C2X or C++17
'static_assert', the only advantage of 'verify' is that its name is a
bit shorter.

   The 'verify.h' header defines one more macro, 'assume (E)', which
expands to an expression of type 'void' that causes the compiler to
assume that E yields a nonzero value.  E should be a scalar expression,
and should not have side effects; it may or may not be evaluated.  The
behavior is undefined if E would yield zero.  The main use of 'assume'
is optimization, as the compiler may be able to generate better code if
it assumes E.  For best results, E should be simple enough that a
compiler can determine that it has no side effects: if E calls an
external function or accesses volatile storage the compiler may not be
able to optimize E away and 'assume (E)' may therefore slow down the
program.

   Here are some example uses of these macros.

     #include <verify.h>

     #include <limits.h>
     #include <time.h>

     /* Verify that time_t is an integer type.  */
     verify ((time_t) 1.5 == 1);

     /* Verify that time_t is no smaller than int.  */
     verify (sizeof (int) <= sizeof (time_t));

     /* Verify that time_t is signed.  */
     verify ((time_t) -1 < 0);

     /* Verify that time_t uses two's complement representation.  */
     verify (~ (time_t) -1 == 0);

     /* Return the maximum value of the integer type T,
        verifying that T is an unsigned integer type.
        The cast to (T) is outside the call to verify_expr
        so that the result is of type T
        even when T is narrower than unsigned int.  */
     #define MAX_UNSIGNED_VAL(t) \
        ((T) verify_expr (0 < (T) -1, -1))

     /* Return T divided by CHAR_MAX + 1, where behavior is
        undefined if T < 0.  In the common case where CHAR_MAX
        is 127 the compiler can therefore implement the division
        by shifting T right 7 bits, an optimization that would
        not be valid if T were negative.  */
     time_t
     time_index (time_t t)
     {
       assume (0 <= t);
       return t / (CHAR_MAX + 1);
     }



15.6 Non-returning Functions
============================

   A "non-returning" function is a function which cannot return
normally.  It can transfer control only through 'longjmp()', 'throw' (in
C++), or similar mechanisms.  The most prominent function of this class
is the 'abort' function.  Non-returning functions are declared with a
'void' return type.

   It helps the compiler's ability to emit sensible warnings, following
data-flow analysis, to declare which functions are non-returning.

   Gnulib has two modules that support such a declaration:

   * The 'stdnoreturn' module.  It provides a way to put this
     declaration at function declarations and function definitions, but
     not in function pointer types.  The identifier to use is
     '_Noreturn' or 'noreturn'; '_Noreturn' is to be preferred because
     'noreturn' is a no-op on some platforms.  The include file is
     '<stdnoreturn.h>'.

   * The 'noreturn' module.  It provides a way to put this declaration
     at function declarations, at function definitions, and in function
     pointer types.  The identifiers to use are:
        - '_GL_NORETURN_FUNC' for use in function declarations and
          function definitions.
        - '_GL_NORETURN_FUNCPTR' for use on function pointers.
     The include file is '<noreturn.h>'.

   Which of the two modules to use?  If the non-returning functions you
have to declare are unlikely to be accessed through function pointers,
you should use module 'stdnoreturn'; otherwise the module 'noreturn'
provides for better data-flow analysis and thus for better warnings.

   For a detailed description of the 'stdnoreturn' module, see *note
stdnoreturn.h::.

15.7 Integer Properties
=======================

   The 'intprops' module consists of an include file '<intprops.h>' that
defines several macros useful for testing properties of integer types.

   Integer overflow is a common source of problems in programs written
in C and other languages.  In some cases, such as signed integer
arithmetic in C programs, the resulting behavior is undefined, and
practical platforms do not always behave as if integers wrap around
reliably.  In other cases, such as unsigned integer arithmetic in C, the
resulting behavior is well-defined, but programs may still misbehave
badly after overflow occurs.

   Many techniques have been proposed to attack these problems.  These
include precondition testing, wraparound behavior where signed integer
arithmetic is guaranteed to be modular, saturation semantics where
overflow reliably yields an extreme value, undefined behavior sanitizers
where overflow is guaranteed to trap, and various static analysis
techniques.

   Gnulib supports wraparound arithmetic and precondition testing, as
these are relatively easy to support portably and efficiently.  There
are two families of precondition tests: the first, for integer types, is
easier to use, while the second, for integer ranges, has a simple and
straightforward portable implementation.

   Like other Gnulib modules, the implementation of the 'intprops'
module assumes that integers use a two's complement representation, but
it does not assume that signed integer arithmetic wraps around.  *Note
Other portability assumptions::.

15.7.1 Arithmetic Type Properties
---------------------------------

   'TYPE_IS_INTEGER (T)' is an arithmetic constant expression that is 1
if the arithmetic type T is an integer type.  '_Bool' counts as an
integer type.

   'TYPE_SIGNED (T)' is an arithmetic constant expression that is 1 if
the real type T is a signed integer type or a floating type.  If T is an
integer type, 'TYPE_SIGNED (T)' is an integer constant expression.

   'EXPR_SIGNED (E)' is 1 if the real expression E has a signed integer
type or a floating type.  If E is an integer constant expression or an
arithmetic constant expression, 'EXPR_SIGNED (E)' is likewise.  The
expression E is not evaluated, and 'EXPR_SIGNED (E)' is typically
optimized to a constant.

   Example usage:

     #include <intprops.h>
     #include <time.h>

     enum
     {
       time_t_is_signed_integer =
         TYPE_IS_INTEGER (time_t) && TYPE_SIGNED (time_t)
     };

     int
     CLOCKS_PER_SEC_is_signed (void)
     {
       return EXPR_SIGNED (CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
     }

15.7.2 Integer Bounds
---------------------

   'INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND (T)' is an integer constant expression that is a
bound on the size of the string representing an integer type or
expression T in decimal notation, including the terminating null
character and any leading '-' character.  For example, if
'INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND (int)' is 12, any value of type 'int' can be
represented in 12 bytes or less, including the terminating null.  The
bound is not necessarily tight.

   Example usage:

     #include <intprops.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     int
     int_strlen (int i)
     {
       char buf[INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND (int)];
       return sprintf (buf, "%d", i);
     }

   'INT_STRLEN_BOUND (T)' is an integer constant expression that is a
bound on the length of the string representing an integer type or
expression T in decimal notation, including any leading '-' character.
This is one less than 'INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND (T)'.

   'TYPE_MINIMUM (T)' and 'TYPE_MAXIMUM (T)' are integer constant
expressions equal to the minimum and maximum values of the integer type
T.  These expressions are of the type T (or more precisely, the type T
after integer promotions).

   Example usage:

     #include <stdint.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <intprops.h>
     int
     in_off_t_range (intmax_t a)
     {
       return TYPE_MINIMUM (off_t) <= a && a <= TYPE_MAXIMUM (off_t);
     }

15.7.3 Checking Integer Overflow
--------------------------------

   Signed integer arithmetic has undefined behavior on overflow in C.
Although almost all modern computers use two's complement signed
arithmetic that is well-defined to wrap around, C compilers routinely
optimize assuming that signed integer overflow cannot occur, which means
that a C program cannot easily get at the underlying machine arithmetic.
For example:

     if ((a + b < b) == (a < 0))
       a += b;
     else
       printf ("overflow\n");

might not work as expected if 'a' and 'b' are signed, because a compiler
can assume that signed overflow cannot occur and treat the entire 'if'
expression as if it were true.  And even if 'a' is unsigned, the
expression might not work as expected if 'b' is negative or is wider
than 'a'.

   The following macros work around this problem by returning an
overflow indication while computing the sum, difference, or product of
two integers.  For example, if 'i' is of type 'int', 'INT_ADD_OK
(INT_MAX - 1, 1, &i)' sets 'i' to 'INT_MAX' and returns true, whereas
'INT_ADD_OK (INT_MAX, 1, &i)' returns false.

   Example usage:

     #include <intprops.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     /* Compute A * B, reporting whether overflow occurred.  */
     void
     print_product (long int a, long int b)
     {
       long int r;
       if (INT_MULTIPLY_OK (a, b, r))
         printf ("result is %ld\n", r);
       else
         printf ("overflow\n");
     }

   These macros work for both signed and unsigned integers, so they can
be used with integer types like 'time_t' that may or may not be signed,
depending on the platform.

   These macros have the following restrictions:

   * Their first two arguments must be integer expressions.

   * Their last argument must be a non-null pointer to an integer.

   * They may evaluate their arguments zero or multiple times, so the
     arguments should not have side effects.

   * They are not necessarily constant expressions, even if all their
     arguments are constant expressions.

'INT_ADD_OK (A, B, R)'
     Compute the sum of A and B.  If it fits into '*R', store it there
     and return true.  Otherwise return false, possibly modifying '*R'
     to an unspecified value.  See above for restrictions.

'INT_SUBTRACT_OK (A, B, R)'
     Compute the difference between A and B.  If it fits into '*R',
     store it there and return true.  Otherwise return false, possibly
     modifying '*R' to an unspecified value.  See above for
     restrictions.

'INT_MULTIPLY_OK (A, B, R)'
     Compute the product of A and B.  If it fits into '*R', store it
     there and return true.  Otherwise return false, possibly modifying
     '*R' to an unspecified value.  See above for restrictions.

   Other macros are available if you need wrapped-around results when
overflow occurs (*note Wraparound Arithmetic::), or if you need to check
for overflow in operations other than addition, subtraction, and
multiplication (*note Integer Type Overflow::).

15.7.4 Wraparound Arithmetic with Integers
------------------------------------------

   Signed integer arithmetic has undefined behavior on overflow in C.
Although almost all modern computers use two's complement signed
arithmetic that is well-defined to wrap around, C compilers routinely
optimize assuming that signed integer overflow cannot occur, which means
that a C program cannot easily get at the underlying machine arithmetic.
For example, on a typical machine with 32-bit two's complement 'int' the
expression 'INT_MAX + 1' does not necessarily yield 'INT_MIN', because
the compiler may do calculations with a 64-bit register, or may generate
code that traps on signed integer overflow.

   The following macros work around this problem by storing the
wraparound value, i.e., the low-order bits of the correct answer, and by
returning an overflow indication.  For example, if 'i' is of type 'int',
'INT_ADD_WRAPV (INT_MAX, 1, &i)' sets 'i' to 'INT_MIN' and returns 1 on
a two's complement machine.  *Note Integer Type Overflow::.

   Example usage:

     #include <intprops.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     /* Print the low order bits of A * B,
        reporting whether overflow occurred.  */
     void
     print_product (long int a, long int b)
     {
       long int r;
       int overflow = INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV (a, b, &r);
       printf ("result is %ld (%s)\n", r,
               (overflow
                ? "after overflow"
                : "no overflow"));
     }

   These macros work for both signed and unsigned integers, so they can
be used with integer types like 'time_t' that may or may not be signed,
depending on the platform.

   These macros have the following restrictions:

   * Their first two arguments must be integer expressions.

   * Their last argument must be a non-null pointer to an integer.

   * They may evaluate their arguments zero or multiple times, so the
     arguments should not have side effects.

   * They are not necessarily constant expressions, even if all their
     arguments are constant expressions.

'INT_ADD_WRAPV (A, B, R)'
     Store the low-order bits of the sum of A and B into '*R'.  Return
     true if overflow occurred, false if the low-order bits are the
     mathematically-correct sum.  See above for restrictions.

'INT_SUBTRACT_WRAPV (A, B, R)'
     Store the low-order bits of the difference between A and B into
     '*R'.  Return true if overflow occurred, false if the low-order
     bits are the mathematically-correct difference.  See above for
     restrictions.

'INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV (A, B, R)'
     Store the low-order bits of the product of A and B into '*R'.
     Return true if overflow occurred, false if the low-order bits are
     the mathematically-correct product.  See above for restrictions.

   Other macros are available if you do not need wrapped-around results
when overflow occurs (*note Checking Integer Overflow::), or if you need
to check for overflow in operations other than addition, subtraction,
and multiplication (*note Integer Type Overflow::).

15.7.5 Integer Type Overflow
----------------------------

   Although unsigned integer arithmetic wraps around modulo a power of
two, signed integer arithmetic has undefined behavior on overflow in C.
Almost all modern computers use two's complement signed arithmetic that
is well-defined to wrap around, but C compilers routinely optimize based
on the assumption that signed integer overflow cannot occur, which means
that a C program cannot easily get at the underlying machine behavior.
For example, the signed integer expression '(a + b < b) != (a < 0)' is
not a reliable test for whether 'a + b' overflows, because a compiler
can assume that signed overflow cannot occur and treat the entire
expression as if it were false.

   These macros yield 1 if the corresponding C operators might not yield
numerically correct answers due to arithmetic overflow of an integer
type.  They work correctly on all known practical hosts, and do not rely
on undefined behavior due to signed arithmetic overflow.  They are
integer constant expressions if their arguments are.  They are typically
easier to use than the integer range overflow macros (*note Integer
Range Overflow::), and they support more operations and evaluation
contexts than the wraparound macros (*note Wraparound Arithmetic::).

   Example usage:

     #include <intprops.h>
     #include <limits.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     /* Print A * B if in range, an overflow
        indicator otherwise.  */
     void
     print_product (long int a, long int b)
     {
       if (INT_MULTIPLY_OVERFLOW (a, b))
         printf ("multiply would overflow");
       else
         printf ("product is %ld", a * b);
     }

     /* Does the product of two ints always fit
        in a long int?  */
     enum {
       INT_PRODUCTS_FIT_IN_LONG
         = ! (INT_MULTIPLY_OVERFLOW
              ((long int) INT_MIN, INT_MIN))
     };

These macros have the following restrictions:

   * Their arguments must be integer expressions.

   * They may evaluate their arguments zero or multiple times, so the
     arguments should not have side effects.

These macros are tuned for their last argument being a constant.

'INT_ADD_OVERFLOW (A, B)'
     Yield 1 if 'A + B' would overflow.  See above for restrictions.

'INT_SUBTRACT_OVERFLOW (A, B)'
     Yield 1 if 'A - B' would overflow.  See above for restrictions.

'INT_NEGATE_OVERFLOW (A)'
     Yields 1 if '-A' would overflow.  See above for restrictions.

'INT_MULTIPLY_OVERFLOW (A, B)'
     Yield 1 if 'A * B' would overflow.  See above for restrictions.

'INT_DIVIDE_OVERFLOW (A, B)'
     Yields 1 if 'A / B' would overflow.  See above for restrictions.
     Division overflow can happen on two's complement hosts when
     dividing the most negative integer by -1.  This macro does not
     check for division by zero.

'INT_REMAINDER_OVERFLOW (A, B)'
     Yield 1 if 'A % B' would overflow.  See above for restrictions.
     Remainder overflow can happen on two's complement hosts when
     dividing the most negative integer by -1; although the mathematical
     result is always 0, in practice some implementations trap, so this
     counts as an overflow.  This macro does not check for division by
     zero.

'INT_LEFT_SHIFT_OVERFLOW (A, B)'
     Yield 1 if 'A << B' would overflow.  See above for restrictions.
     The C standard says that behavior is undefined for shifts unless
     0<=B<W where W is A's word width, and that when A is negative then
     'A << B' has undefined behavior, but this macro does not check
     these other restrictions.

15.7.6 Integer Range Overflow
-----------------------------

   These macros yield 1 if the corresponding C operators might not yield
numerically correct answers due to arithmetic overflow.  They do not
rely on undefined or implementation-defined behavior.  They are integer
constant expressions if their arguments are.  Their implementations are
simple and straightforward, but they are typically harder to use than
the integer type overflow macros.  *Note Integer Type Overflow::.

   Although the implementation of these macros is similar to that
suggested in the SEI CERT C Secure Coding Standard, in its two sections
"INT30-C.  Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not wrap
(https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/INT30-C.+Ensure+that+unsigned+integer+operations+do+not+wrap)"
and "INT32-C.  Ensure that operations on signed integers do not result
in overflow
(https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/INT32-C.+Ensure+that+operations+on+signed+integers+do+not+result+in+overflow)",
Gnulib's implementation was derived independently of CERT's suggestions.

   Example usage:

     #include <intprops.h>
     #include <limits.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     void
     print_product (long int a, long int b)
     {
       if (INT_MULTIPLY_RANGE_OVERFLOW (a, b, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX))
         printf ("multiply would overflow");
       else
         printf ("product is %ld", a * b);
     }

     /* Does the product of two ints always fit
        in a long int?  */
     enum {
       INT_PRODUCTS_FIT_IN_LONG
         = ! (INT_MULTIPLY_RANGE_OVERFLOW
              ((long int) INT_MIN, (long int) INT_MIN,
               LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX))
     };

These macros have the following restrictions:

   * Their arguments must be integer expressions.

   * They may evaluate their arguments zero or multiple times, so the
     arguments should not have side effects.

   * The arithmetic arguments (including the MIN and MAX arguments) must
     be of the same integer type after the usual arithmetic conversions,
     and the type must have minimum value MIN and maximum MAX.  Unsigned
     values should use a zero MIN of the proper type, for example,
     '(unsigned int) 0'.

These macros are tuned for constant MIN and MAX.  For commutative
operations such as 'A + B', they are also tuned for constant B.

'INT_ADD_RANGE_OVERFLOW (A, B, MIN, MAX)'
     Yield 1 if 'A + B' would overflow in [MIN,MAX] integer arithmetic.
     See above for restrictions.

'INT_SUBTRACT_RANGE_OVERFLOW (A, B, MIN, MAX)'
     Yield 1 if 'A - B' would overflow in [MIN,MAX] integer arithmetic.
     See above for restrictions.

'INT_NEGATE_RANGE_OVERFLOW (A, MIN, MAX)'
     Yield 1 if '-A' would overflow in [MIN,MAX] integer arithmetic.
     See above for restrictions.

'INT_MULTIPLY_RANGE_OVERFLOW (A, B, MIN, MAX)'
     Yield 1 if 'A * B' would overflow in [MIN,MAX] integer arithmetic.
     See above for restrictions.

'INT_DIVIDE_RANGE_OVERFLOW (A, B, MIN, MAX)'
     Yield 1 if 'A / B' would overflow in [MIN,MAX] integer arithmetic.
     See above for restrictions.  Division overflow can happen on two's
     complement hosts when dividing the most negative integer by -1.
     This macro does not check for division by zero.

'INT_REMAINDER_RANGE_OVERFLOW (A, B, MIN, MAX)'
     Yield 1 if 'A % B' would overflow in [MIN,MAX] integer arithmetic.
     See above for restrictions.  Remainder overflow can happen on two's
     complement hosts when dividing the most negative integer by -1;
     although the mathematical result is always 0, in practice some
     implementations trap, so this counts as an overflow.  This macro
     does not check for division by zero.

'INT_LEFT_SHIFT_RANGE_OVERFLOW (A, B, MIN, MAX)'
     Yield 1 if 'A << B' would overflow in [MIN,MAX] integer arithmetic.
     See above for restrictions.  Here, MIN and MAX are for A only, and
     B need not be of the same type as the other arguments.  The C
     standard says that behavior is undefined for shifts unless 0<=B<W
     where W is A's word width, and that when A is negative then 'A <<
     B' has undefined behavior, but this macro does not check these
     other restrictions.

15.8 Static inline functions
============================

   In order to mark functions as 'static inline', the only prerequisite
you need is an 'AC_REQUIRE([AC_C_INLINE])'.  No Gnulib module is needed.

15.9 Extern inline functions
============================

   The 'extern-inline' module supports the use of C99-style 'extern
inline' functions so that the code still runs on compilers that do not
support this feature correctly.

   C code ordinarily should not use 'inline'.  Typically it is better to
let the compiler figure out whether to inline, as compilers are pretty
good about optimization nowadays.  In this sense, 'inline' is like
'register', another keyword that is typically no longer needed.

   Functions defined (not merely declared) in headers are an exception,
as avoiding 'inline' would commonly cause problems for these functions.
Suppose 'aaa.h' defines the function 'aaa_fun', and 'aaa.c', 'bbb.c' and
'ccc.c' all include 'aaa.h'.  If code is intended to portable to non-C99
compilers, 'aaa_fun' cannot be declared with the C99 'inline' keyword.
This problem cannot be worked around by making 'aaa_fun' an ordinary
function, as it would be defined three times with external linkage and
the definitions would clash.  Although 'aaa_fun' could be a static
function, with separate compilation if 'aaa_fun' is not inlined its code
will appear in the executable three times.

   To avoid this code bloat, 'aaa.h' can do this:

     /* aaa.h */
     /* #include any other headers here */
     #ifndef _GL_INLINE_HEADER_BEGIN
      #error "Please include config.h first."
     #endif
     _GL_INLINE_HEADER_BEGIN
     #ifndef AAA_INLINE
     # define AAA_INLINE _GL_INLINE
     #endif
     ...
     AAA_INLINE int
     aaa_fun (int i)
     {
       return i + 1;
     }
     ...
     _GL_INLINE_HEADER_END

and 'aaa.c' can do this:

     /* aaa.c */
     #include <config.h>
     #define AAA_INLINE _GL_EXTERN_INLINE
     #include <aaa.h>

whereas 'bbb.c' and 'ccc.c' can include 'aaa.h' in the usual way.  C99
compilers expand 'AAA_INLINE' to C99-style 'inline' usage, where
'aaa_fun' is declared 'extern inline' in 'aaa.c' and plain 'inline' in
other modules.  Non-C99 compilers that are compatible with GCC use
GCC-specific syntax to accomplish the same ends.  Other non-C99
compilers use 'static inline' so they suffer from code bloat, but they
are not mainline platforms and will die out eventually.

   '_GL_INLINE' is a portable alternative to C99 plain 'inline'.

   '_GL_EXTERN_INLINE' is a portable alternative to C99 'extern inline'.

   Invoke '_GL_INLINE_HEADER_BEGIN' before all uses of '_GL_INLINE' in
an include file.  This suppresses some bogus warnings in GCC versions
before 5.1.  If an include file includes other files, it is better to
invoke this macro after including the other files.

   Invoke '_GL_INLINE_HEADER_END' after all uses of '_GL_INLINE' in an
include file.

15.10 Handling closed standard file descriptors
===============================================

   Usually, when a program gets invoked, its file descriptors 0 (for
standard input), 1 (for standard output), and 2 (for standard error) are
open.  But there are situations when some of these file descriptors are
closed.  These situations can arise when
   * The invoking process invokes 'close()' on the file descriptor
     before 'exec', or
   * The invoking process invokes 'posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose()'
     for the file descriptor before 'posix_spawn' or 'posix_spawnp', or
   * The invoking process is a Bourne shell, and the shell script uses
     the POSIX syntax for closing the file descriptor: '<&-' for closing
     standard input, '>&-' for closing standard output, or '2>&-' for
     closing standard error.

   When a closed file descriptor is accessed through a system call, such
as 'fcntl()', 'fstat()', 'read()', or 'write()', the system calls fails
with error 'EBADF' ("Bad file descriptor").

   When a new file descriptor is allocated, the operating system chooses
the smallest non-negative integer that does not yet correspond to an
open file descriptor.  So, when a given fd (0, 1, or 2) is closed,
opening a new file descriptor may assign the new file descriptor to this
fd.  This can have unintended effects, because now standard
input/output/error of your process is referring to a file that was not
meant to be used in that role.

   This situation is a security risk because the behaviour of the
program in this situation was surely never tested, therefore anything
can happen then - from overwriting precious files of the user to endless
loops.

   To deal with this situation, you first need to determine whether your
program is affected by the problem.
   * Does your program invoke functions that allocate new file
     descriptors?  These are the system calls
        * 'open()', 'openat()', 'creat()'
        * 'dup()'
        * 'fopen()', 'freopen()'
        * 'pipe()', 'pipe2()', 'popen()'
        * 'opendir()'
        * 'tmpfile()', 'mkstemp()', 'mkstemps()', 'mkostemp()',
          'mkostemps()'
     Note that you also have to consider the libraries that your program
     uses.
   * If your program may open two or more file descriptors or FILE
     streams for reading at the same time, and some of them may
     reference standard input, your program _is affected_.
   * If your program may open two or more file descriptors or FILE
     streams for writing at the same time, and some of them may
     reference standard output or standard error, your program _is
     affected_.
   * If your program does not open new file descriptors or FILE streams,
     it is _not affected_.
   * If your program opens only one new file descriptor or FILE stream
     at a time, it is _not affected_.  This is often the case for
     programs that are structured in simple phases: first a phase where
     input is read from a file into memory, then a phase of processing
     in memory, finally a phase where the result is written to a file.
   * If your program opens only two new file descriptors or FILE streams
     at a time, out of which one is for reading and the one is for
     writing, it is _not affected_.  This is because if the first file
     descriptor is allocated and the second file descriptor is picked as
     0, 1, or 2, and both happen to be the same, writing to the one
     opened in 'O_RDONLY' mode will produce an error 'EBADF', as
     desired.

   If your program is affected, what is the mitigation?

   Some operating systems install open file descriptors in place of the
closed ones, either in the 'exec' system call or during program startup.
When such a file descriptor is accessed through a system call, it
behaves like an open file descriptor opened for the "wrong" direction:
the system calls 'fcntl()' and 'fstat()' succeed, whereas 'read()' from
fd 0 and 'write()' to fd 1 or 2 fail with error 'EBADF' ("Bad file
descriptor").  The important point here is that when your program
allocates a new file descriptor, it will have a value greater than 2.

   This mitigation is enabled on HP-UX, for all programs, and on glibc,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, but only for setuid or setgid programs.  Since
it is operating system dependent, it is not a complete mitigation.

   For a complete mitigation, Gnulib provides two alternative sets of
modules:
   * The 'xstdopen' module.
   * The '*-safer' modules: 'fcntl-safer', 'openat-safer',
     'unistd-safer', 'fopen-safer', 'freopen-safer', 'pipe2-safer',
     'popen-safer', 'dirent-safer', 'tmpfile-safer', 'stdlib-safer'.

   The approach with the 'xstdopen' module is simpler, but it adds three
system calls to program startup.  Whereas the approach with the
'*-safer' modules is more complex, but adds no overhead (no additional
system calls) in the normal case.

   To use the approach with the 'xstdopen' module:
  1. Import the module 'xstdopen' from Gnulib.
  2. In the compilation unit that contains the 'main' function, include
     '"xstdopen.h"'.
  3. In the 'main' function, near the beginning, namely right after the
     i18n related initializations ('setlocale', 'bindtextdomain',
     'textdomain' invocations, if any) and the 'closeout' initialization
     (if any), insert the invocation:
          /* Ensure that stdin, stdout, stderr are open.  */
          xstdopen ();

   To use the approach with the '*-safer' modules:
  1. Import the relevant modules from Gnulib.
  2. In the compilation units that contain these function calls, include
     the replacement header file.
   Do so according to this table:
Function             Module                  Header file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'open()'             'fcntl-safer'           '"fcntl--.h"'
'openat()'           'openat-safer'          '"fcntl--.h"'
'creat()'            'fcntl-safer'           '"fcntl--.h"'
'dup()'              'unistd-safer'          '"unistd--.h"'
'fopen()'            'fopen-safer'           '"stdio--.h"'
'freopen()'          'freopen-safer'         '"stdio--.h"'
'pipe()'             'unistd-safer'          '"unistd--.h"'
'pipe2()'            'pipe2-safer'           '"unistd--.h"'
'popen()'            'popen-safer'           '"stdio--.h"'
'opendir()'          'dirent-safer'          '"dirent--.h"'
'tmpfile()'          'tmpfile-safer'         '"stdio--.h"'
'mkstemp()'          'stdlib-safer'          '"stdlib--.h"'
'mkstemps()'         'stdlib-safer'          '"stdlib--.h"'
'mkostemp()'         'stdlib-safer'          '"stdlib--.h"'
'mkostemps()'        'stdlib-safer'          '"stdlib--.h"'

15.11 Container data types
==========================

   Gnulib provides several generic container data types.  They can be
used to organize collections of application-defined objects.

Data type   Details                              Module  Main    Include
                                                         include file for
                                                         file    operations
                                                                 with
                                                                 out-of-memory
                                                                 checking
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sequential  Can contain any number of objects    'list'  '"gl_list.h"''"gl_xlist.h"'
list        in any given order.  Duplicates
            are allowed, but can optionally be
            forbidden.
Set         Can contain any number of objects;   'set'   '"gl_set.h"''"gl_xset.h"'
            the order does not matter.
            Duplicates (in the sense of the
            comparator) are forbidden.
Ordered     Can contain any number of objects    'oset'  '"gl_oset.h"''"gl_xoset.h"'
set         in the order of a given comparator
            function.  Duplicates (in the
            sense of the comparator) are
            forbidden.
Map         Can contain any number of (key,      'map'   '"gl_map.h"''"gl_xmap.h"'
            value) pairs, where keys and
            values are objects; there are no
            (key, value1) and (key, value2)
            pairs with the same key (in the
            sense of a given comparator
            function).
Ordered     Can contain any number of (key,      'omap'  '"gl_omap.h"''"gl_xomap.h"'
map         value) pairs, where keys and
            values are objects; the (key,
            value) pairs are ordered by the
            key, in the order of a given
            comparator function; there are no
            (key, value1) and (key, value2)
            pairs with the same key (in the
            sense of the comparator function).

   Operations without out-of-memory checking (suitable for use in
libraries) are declared in the "main include file".  Whereas operations
with out-of-memory checking (suitable only in programs) are declared in
the "include file for operations with out-of-memory checking".

   For each of the data types, several implementations are available,
with different performance profiles with respect to the available
operations.  This enables you to start with the simplest implementation
(ARRAY) initially, and switch to a more suitable implementation after
profiling your application.  The implementation of each container
instance is specified in a single place only: in the invocation of the
function 'gl_*_create_empty' that creates the instance.

   The implementations and the guaranteed average performance for the
operations for the "sequential list" data type are:

Operation      ARRAY   CARRAY  LINKED  TREE    LINKEDHASHLINKEDHASHTREEHASHTREEHASH
                                               with    without with    without

15.12 Character and String Functions in C Locale
================================================

   The functions in this section are similar to the generic string
functions from the standard C library, except that
   * They behave as if the locale was set to the "C" locale, even when
     the locale is different, and/or
   * They are specially optimized for the case where all characters are
     plain ASCII characters.

15.12.1 c-ctype
---------------

   The 'c-ctype' module contains functions operating on single-byte
characters, like the functions in '<ctype.h>', that operate as if the
locale encoding was ASCII.  (The "C" locale on many systems has the
locale encoding "ASCII".)

   The functions are:
     extern bool c_isascii (int c);

     extern bool c_isalnum (int c);
     extern bool c_isalpha (int c);
     extern bool c_isblank (int c);
     extern bool c_iscntrl (int c);
     extern bool c_isdigit (int c);
     extern bool c_islower (int c);
     extern bool c_isgraph (int c);
     extern bool c_isprint (int c);
     extern bool c_ispunct (int c);
     extern bool c_isspace (int c);
     extern bool c_isupper (int c);
     extern bool c_isxdigit (int c);

     extern int c_tolower (int c);
     extern int c_toupper (int c);

   These functions assign properties only to ASCII characters.

   The C argument can be a 'char' or 'unsigned char' value, whereas the
corresponding functions in '<ctype.h>' take an argument that is actually
an 'unsigned char' value.

   The 'c_is*' functions return 'bool', where the corresponding
functions in '<ctype.h>' return 'int' for historical reasons.

   Note: The '<ctype.h>' functions support only unibyte locales.

15.12.2 c-strcase
-----------------

   The 'c-strcase' module contains case-insensitive string comparison
functions operating on single-byte character strings, like the functions
in '<strings.h>', that operate as if the locale encoding was ASCII. (The
"C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

   The functions are:
     extern int c_strcasecmp (const char *s1, const char *s2);
     extern int c_strncasecmp (const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

   For case conversion here, only ASCII characters are considered to be
upper case or lower case.

   Note: The functions 'strcasecmp', 'strncasecmp' from '<strings.h>'
support only unibyte locales; for multibyte locales, you need the
functions 'mbscasecmp', 'mbsncasecmp', 'mbspcasecmp'.

15.12.3 c-strcaseeq
-------------------

   The 'c-strcaseeq' module contains an optimized case-insensitive
string comparison function operating on single-byte character strings,
that operate as if the locale encoding was ASCII. (The "C" locale on
many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

   The functions is actually implemented as a macro:
     extern int STRCASEEQ (const char *s1, const char *s2,
                           int s20, int s21, int s22, int s23, int s24, int s25,
                           int s26, int s27, int s28);

   S2 should be a short literal ASCII string, and S20, S21, ...  the
individual characters of S2.

   For case conversion here, only ASCII characters are considered to be
upper case or lower case.

15.12.4 c-strcasestr
--------------------

   The 'c-strcasestr' module contains a case-insensitive string search
function operating on single-byte character strings, that operate as if
the locale encoding was ASCII. (The "C" locale on many systems has the
locale encoding "ASCII".)

   The function is:
     extern char *c_strcasestr (const char *haystack, const char *needle);

   For case conversion here, only ASCII characters are considered to be
upper case or lower case.

   Note: The function 'strcasestr' from '<string.h>' supports only
unibyte locales; for multibyte locales, you need the function
'mbscasestr'.

15.12.5 c-strstr
----------------

   The 'c-strstr' module contains a substring search function operating
on single-byte character strings, that operate as if the locale encoding
was ASCII. (The "C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding
"ASCII".)

   The function is:
     extern char *c_strstr (const char *haystack, const char *needle);

   Note: The function 'strstr' from '<string.h>' supports only unibyte
locales; for multibyte locales, you need the function 'mbsstr'.

15.12.6 c-strtod
----------------

   The 'c-strtod' module contains a string to number ('double')
conversion function operating on single-byte character strings, that
operates as if the locale encoding was ASCII. (The "C" locale on many
systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

   The function is:
     extern double c_strtod (const char *string, char **endp);

   In particular, only a period '.' is accepted as decimal point, even
when the current locale's notion of decimal point is a comma ',', and no
characters outside the basic character set are accepted.

   On platforms without 'strtod_l', this function is not safe for use in
multi-threaded applications since it calls 'setlocale'.

15.12.7 c-strtold
-----------------

   The 'c-strtold' module contains a string to number ('long double')
conversion function operating on single-byte character strings, that
operates as if the locale encoding was ASCII. (The "C" locale on many
systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

   The function is:
     extern long double c_strtold (const char *string, char **endp);

   In particular, only a period '.' is accepted as decimal point, even
when the current locale's notion of decimal point is a comma ','.

15.13 Recognizing Option Arguments
==================================

   The module 'argmatch' provides a simple textual user interface to a
finite choice.  It is for example well suited to recognize arguments of
options or values of environment variables that accept a fixed set of
valid choices.

   These choices may be denoted by synonyms, such as 'none' and 'off'
below.

     $ my_cp --backup=none foo bar
     $ my_cp --backup=non foo bar
     $ my_cp --backup=no foo bar
     $ my_cp --backup=n foo bar
     my_cp: ambiguous argument 'n' for 'backup type'
     Valid arguments are:
       - 'no', 'none', 'off'
       - 'numbered', 't', 'newstyle'
       - 'existing', 'nil', 'numbered-existing'
       - 'simple', 'never', 'single'
     Try 'my_cp --help' for more information.
     $ my_cp --backup=num foo bar
     $ my_cp --backup=true foo bar
     my_cp: invalid argument 'true' for 'backup type'
     Valid arguments are:
       - 'no', 'none', 'off'
       - 'numbered', 't', 'newstyle'
       - 'existing', 'nil', 'numbered-existing'
       - 'simple', 'never', 'single'
     Try 'my_cp --help' for more information.

   To set up 'argmatch', first call 'ARGMATCH_DEFINE_GROUP (NAME, TYPE)'
with the name of the argmatch group name, and the value type.  For
instance:

     enum backup_type
     {
       no_backups,
       simple_backups,
       numbered_existing_backups,
       numbered_backups
     };

     ARGMATCH_DEFINE_GROUP (backup, enum backup_type);

This defines a few types and functions named 'argmatch_NAME_*'.
Introduce the array that defines the mapping from user-input to actual
value, with a terminator:

     static const argmatch_backup_arg argmatch_backup_args[] =
     {
       { "no",                no_backups },
       { "none",              no_backups },
       { "off",               no_backups },
       { "simple",            simple_backups },
       { "never",             simple_backups },
       { "single",            simple_backups },
       { "existing",          numbered_existing_backups },
       { "nil",               numbered_existing_backups },
       { "numbered-existing", numbered_existing_backups },
       { "numbered",          numbered_backups },
       { "t",                 numbered_backups },
       { "newstyle",          numbered_backups },
       { NULL, no_backups }
     };

Then introduce the array that defines the values, also with a
terminator.  Document only once per group of synonyms:

     static const argmatch_backup_doc argmatch_backup_docs[] =
     {
       { "no",       N_("never make backups (even if --backup is given)") },
       { "numbered", N_("make numbered backups") },
       { "existing", N_("numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise") },
       { "simple",   N_("always make simple backups") },
       { NULL, NULL }
     };

Finally, define the argmatch group:

     const argmatch_backup_group_type argmatch_backup_group =
     {
       argmatch_backup_args,
       argmatch_backup_docs,
       N_("\
     The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.\n\
     The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through\n\
     the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:\n"),
       NULL
     };


   To use the argmatch group:

     ptrdiff_t i = argmatch_backup_choice ("--backup", "none");
     // argmatch_backup_group.args[i].arg is "none", so its value
     // is argmatch_backup_group.args[i].val.
     // Return -1 on invalid argument, and -2 on ambiguity.

     enum backup_type val = *argmatch_backup_value ("--backup", "none");
     // Returns a pointer to the value, and exit on errors.
     // So argmatch_backup_group.args[i].val == val.

     const char *arg = argmatch_backup_argument (&no_backups);
     // arg is "no".

     // Print the documentation on stdout.
     argmatch_backup_usage (stdout);
     // Gives:
     //
     // The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
     // The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through
     // the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:
     //
     //   no, none, off  never make backups (even if --backup is given)
     //   numbered, t, newstyle
     //                  make numbered backups
     //   existing, nil, numbered-existing
     //                  numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
     //   simple, never, single
     //                  always make simple backups

   Gnulib provides 'quote' and 'quotearg' modules to help with quoting
text, such as file names, in messages to the user.  Here's an example of
using 'quote':

     #include <quote.h>
      ...
       error (0, errno, _("cannot change owner of %s"), quote (fname));

   This differs from

       error (0, errno, _("cannot change owner of '%s'"), fname);

in that 'quote' escapes unusual characters in 'fname', e.g., ''' and
control characters like '\n'.

   However, a caveat: 'quote' reuses the storage that it returns.  Hence
if you need more than one thing quoted at the same time, you need to use
'quote_n'.

   Also, the 'quote' module is not suited for multithreaded
applications.  In that case, you have to use 'quotearg_alloc', defined
in the 'quotearg' module, which is decidedly less convenient.

15.15 progname and getprogname
==============================

   Gnulib has two modules for retrieving the name of the currently
executing program: 'progname' and 'getprogname'.

   The 'progname' module defines a variable 'program_name'.  It contains
the name of the currently executing program, on all platforms.  But it
cannot be used implicitly: It requires that every 'main' function be
modified to invoke 'set_program_name (argv[0])' as one of its first
actions.

   The 'getprogname' module defines a function 'getprogname()'.  It
returns the name of the currently executing program, on most platforms.
The advantage of this module is that it can be used without prior
initializations.  But it has limitations: In some rare situations, it
cannot determine the name; then it returns '"?"' instead.  And on some
platforms, it returns a truncated program name.

   The 'error' function uses the 'getprogname' module.

15.16 gcd: greatest common divisor
==================================

   The 'gcd' function returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers
'a > 0' and 'b > 0'.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that
the arguments are non-zero.

   If you need a gcd function for an integer type larger than 'unsigned
long', you can include the 'gcd.c' implementation file with
parametrization.  The parameters are:

   * WORD_T Define this to the unsigned integer type that you need this
     function for.

   * GCD Define this to the name of the function to be created.

   The created function has the prototype
     WORD_T GCD (WORD_T a, WORD_T b);

   If you need the least common multiple of two numbers, it can be
computed like this: 'lcm(a,b) = (a / gcd(a,b)) * b' or 'lcm(a,b) = a *
(b / gcd(a,b))'.  Avoid the formula 'lcm(a,b) = (a * b) / gcd(a,b)'
because--although mathematically correct--it can yield a wrong result,
due to integer overflow.

   In some applications it is useful to have a function taking the gcd
of two signed numbers.  In this case, the gcd function result is usually
normalized to be non-negative (so that two gcd results can be compared
in magnitude or compared against 1, etc.).  Note that in this case the
prototype of the function has to be
     unsigned long gcd (long a, long b);
   and not
     long gcd (long a, long b);
   because 'gcd(LONG_MIN,LONG_MIN) = -LONG_MIN = LONG_MAX + 1' does not
fit into a signed 'long'.

15.17 Profiling of program phases
=================================

   The module 'timevar' provides a simple self-profiling facility, based
on timers.

     Execution times (seconds)
     read                  :   0.09 (19%) usr   0.08 (80%) sys   0.09 (18%) wall
     read: scan            :   0.04 ( 9%) usr   0.08 (80%) sys   0.12 (26%) wall
     read: parse           :   0.05 (10%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.05 (10%) wall
     work                  :   0.33 (70%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.35 (71%) wall
     work: phase 1         :   0.30 (64%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.30 (64%) wall
     work: phase 2         :   0.13 (28%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.14 (29%) wall
     output                :   0.04 ( 9%) usr   0.02 (20%) sys   0.04 ( 8%) wall
     total time            :   0.47             0.10             0.49

   To set up 'timevar', copy the stub file 'gnulib/lib/timevar.def' next
to where 'timevar.h' and 'timevar.c' were imported in your project, and
define your timers there.  For instance:

     /* The total execution time.  Mandatory.  */
     DEFTIMEVAR (tv_total,      "total time")

     /* Examples.  */
     DEFTIMEVAR (tv_read,       "read")
     DEFTIMEVAR (tv_work,       "work")
     DEFTIMEVAR (tv_work_1,     "work: phase 1")
     DEFTIMEVAR (tv_work_2,     "work: phase 2")
     DEFTIMEVAR (tv_output,     "output")

   Do not remove 'tv_total', it is mandatory.  You may change its
associated string.


   Use 'timevar_push'/'timevar_pop' to start/stop timers, as in the
following example.

     #include <config.h>
     #include "timevar.h"

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "read.h"
     #include "work.h"
     #include "output.h"

     int
     main (void)
     {
       timevar_enabled = true;
       timevar_init ();
       timevar_start (tv_total);

       timevar_push (tv_read);
       reader ();
       timevar_pop (tv_read);

       timevar_push (tv_work);
       work ();
       timevar_pop (tv_work);

       timevar_push (tv_output);
       output ();
       timevar_pop (tv_output);

       timevar_stop (tv_total);
       timevar_print (stderr);
     }

with, for instance, in 'work.c'

     #include <config.h>
     #include "work.h"

     void
     work (void)
     {
       timevar_push (tv_work_phase1);
       work1 ();
       timevar_pop (tv_work_phase1);

       timevar_push (tv_work_phase2);
       work2 ();
       timevar_pop (tv_work_phase2);
     }

15.18 Library version handling
==============================

   The module 'check-version' can be useful when your gnulib application
is a system library.  You will typically wrap the call to the
'check_version' function through a library API, your library header file
may contain:

     #define STRINGPREP_VERSION "0.5.18"
     ...
       extern const char *stringprep_check_version (const char *req_version);

   To avoid ELF symbol collisions with other libraries that use the
'check-version' module, add to 'config.h' through a AC_DEFINE something
like:

     AC_DEFINE(check_version, stringprep_check_version,
               [Rename check_version.])

   The 'stringprep_check_version' function will thus be implemented by
the 'check_version' module.

   There are two uses of the interface.  The first is a way to provide
for applications to find out the version number of the library it uses.
The application may contain diagnostic code such as:

       printf ("Stringprep version: header %s library %s",
               STRINGPREP_VERSION,
               stringprep_check_version (NULL));

   Separating the library and header file version can be useful when
searching for version mismatch related problems.

   The second uses is as a rudimentary test of proper library version,
by making sure the application get a library version that is the same,
or newer, than the header file used when building the application.  This
doesn't catch all problems, libraries may change backwards incompatibly
in later versions, but enable applications to require a certain minimum
version before it may proceed.

   Typical uses look like:

            /* Check version of libgcrypt. */
            if (!gcry_check_version (GCRYPT_VERSION))
              die ("version mismatch\n");

15.19 Supporting Relocation
===========================

   It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time
that packages are not relocatable.  It means a user cannot copy a
program, installed by another user on the same machine, to his home
directory, and have it work correctly (including i18n).  So many users
need to go through 'configure; make; make install' with all its
dependencies, options, and hurdles.

   Red Hat, Debian, and other binary distributions solve the "ease of
installation" problem, but they hardwire path names, usually to '/usr'
or '/usr/local'.  This means that users need root privileges to install
a binary package, and prevents installing two different versions of the
same binary package.

   A relocatable program can be moved or copied to a different location
on the file system.  It is possible to make symlinks to the installed
and moved programs, and invoke them through the symlink.  It is possible
to do the same thing with a hard link _only_ if the hard link file is in
the same directory as the real program.

   The 'relocatable-prog' module aims to ease the process of making a
GNU program relocatable.  It helps overcome two obstacles.  First, it
aids with relocating the hard-coded references to absolute file names
that GNU programs often contain.  These references must be fixed up at
runtime if a program is to be successfully relocated.  The
'relocatable-prog' module provides a function 'relocate' that does this
job.

   Second, the loader must be able to find shared libraries linked to
relocatable executables or referenced by other shared libraries linked
to relocatable executables.  The 'relocatable-prog' module helps out
here in a platform-specific way:

   * On most operating systems, it adds a linker option ('-rpath') that
     causes the dynamic linker to search for libraries in a directory
     relative to the location of the invoked executable.  This works on
     GNU/Linux and modern versions of GNU/Hurd, GNU/kFreeBSD, macOS,
     FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Haiku.

   * On other Unix systems, it installs a trampoline executable.  The
     trampoline sets the environment variable that controls shared
     library searching (usually 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH') and then invokes the
     real executable.  This applies to operating systems such as AIX,
     HP-UX, or Minix.

   * On Windows, the executable's own directory is searched for
     libraries, so installing shared libraries into the executable's
     directory is sufficient.

   You can make your program relocatable by following these steps:

  1. Import the 'relocatable-prog' module.  For libraries, use the
     'relocatable-lib' or 'relocatable-lib-lgpl' module, if the
     libraries are independent.  For installing multiple libraries, at
     least one of which depends on another one, use the
     'relocatable-prog' module.  If you need more than one module, or
     you need to use them with different settings, you will need
     multiple copies of gnulib (*note Multiple instances::).

  2. In every program, add to 'main' as the first statement (even before
     setting the locale or doing anything related to libintl):

          set_program_name (argv[0]);

     The prototype for this function is in 'progname.h'.

  3. If you want your code to be portable to platforms that do not
     support automatic initialization, call 'set_relocation_prefix'.

  4. Everywhere where you use a constant pathname from
     installation-time, wrap it in 'relocate' so it gets translated to
     the run-time situation.  Example:

          bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR);

     becomes:

          bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, relocate (LOCALEDIR));

     The prototype for this function is in 'relocatable.h'.

     There is also a variant of this function, named 'relocate2', that
     makes it easy to reclaim the memory allocated by the call.

  5. The 'set_program_name' function can also configure some additional
     libraries to relocate files that they access, by defining
     corresponding C preprocessor symbols to 1.  The libraries for which
     this is supported and the corresponding preprocessor symbols are:

     libcharset
          'DEPENDS_ON_LIBCHARSET'

     libiconv
          'DEPENDS_ON_LIBICONV'

     libintl
          'DEPENDS_ON_LIBINTL'

     Defining the symbol for a library makes every program in the
     package depend on that library, whether the program really uses the
     library or not, so this feature should be used with some caution.

  6. If your package installs shell scripts, also import the
     'relocatable-script' module.  Then, near the beginning of each
     shell script that your package installs, add the following:

          @relocatable_sh@

          prefix="@prefix@"
          exec_prefix="@exec_prefix@"   # usually needs $prefix.
          datarootdir="@datarootdir@"   # usually needs $prefix.

          if test "@RELOCATABLE@" = yes; then
            bindir="@bindir@"
            orig_installdir="$bindir" # see Makefile.am's *_SCRIPTS variables
            func_find_curr_installdir # determine curr_installdir
            func_find_prefixes
            relocate () {
              echo "$1/" \
              | sed -e "s%^${orig_installprefix}/%${curr_installprefix}/%" \
              | sed -e 's,/$,,'
            }
          else
            relocate () {
              echo "$1"
            }
          fi

          # Get some relocated directory names.
          sysconfdir=`relocate "@sysconfdir@"`          # usually needs $prefix.
          some_datadir=`relocate "@datadir@/something"` # usually needs $datarootdir.
          bindir=`relocate "@bindir@"`       # usually needs $exec_prefix, hence $prefix.

     You must adapt the definition of 'orig_installdir', depending on
     where the script gets installed.  Also, at the end, instead of
     'sysconfdir' and 'some_datadir', transform those variables that you
     need.

  7. If your package installs Perl scripts, also import the
     'relocatable-perl' module.  Then, near the beginning of each Perl
     script that your package installs, add the following:

          @relocatable_pl@
          if ("@RELOCATABLE@" eq "yes") {
            my $exec_prefix = "@exec_prefix@";
            my $orig_installdir = "@bindir@"; # see Makefile.am's *_SCRIPTS variables
            my ($orig_installprefix, $curr_installprefix) =
              find_prefixes($orig_installdir, find_curr_installdir());

            # the subroutine is defined whether or not the enclosing block is executed
            sub relocate {
              my ($dir) = @_;
              if ("@RELOCATABLE@" eq "yes") {
                $dir =~ s%^$orig_installprefix/%$curr_installprefix/%;
                $dir =~ s,/$,,;
              }
              return $dir;
            }
          }

          # Get some relocated directory names.
          # (The gnulib module 'configmake' can help with this.)
          $sysconfdir = relocate("@sysconfdir@");
          $some_datadir = relocate(@datadir@/something");

     You must adapt the definition of '$orig_installdir', depending on
     where the script gets installed.  Also, at the end, instead of
     'sysconfdir' and 'some_datadir', transform those variables that you
     need.

  8. In your 'Makefile.am', for every program 'foo' that gets installed
     in, say, '$(bindir)', you add:

          foo_CPPFLAGS = -DINSTALLDIR=\"$(bindir)\"
          if RELOCATABLE_VIA_LD
          foo_LDFLAGS = `$(RELOCATABLE_LDFLAGS) $(bindir)`
          endif

     When building gnulib to use with a relocatable library, you need to
     define the preprocessor symbol 'IN_LIBRARY'.  You may also want to
     build with 'ENABLE_COSTLY_RELOCATABLE', in which case you will also
     need to define 'INSTALLDIR'.  The following fragment can be added
     to an override 'Makefile.am' used to build gnulib (*note Modified
     build rules::).

          AM_CPPFLAGS += -DIN_LIBRARY -DENABLE_COSTLY_RELOCATABLE

          if SHLIBS_IN_BINDIR
          AM_CPPFLAGS += -DINSTALLDIR=\"$(bindir)\"
          else
          AM_CPPFLAGS += -DINSTALLDIR=\"$(libdir)\"
          endif

     'SHLIBS_IN_BINDIR' is defined in 'configure.ac' as follows:

          AM_CONDITIONAL([SHLIBS_IN_BINDIR],
                         [case "$host_os" in mingw* | cygwin*) true;; *) false;; esac])

  9. In your 'Makefile.am', for every library 'libfoo' that gets
     installed in, say, '$(libdir)', you add:

          if RELOCATABLE_VIA_LD
          libfoo_la_LDFLAGS = `$(RELOCATABLE_LDFLAGS) $(libdir)`
          endif

  10. Add a couple of variable assignments to your 'Makefile.am'.

     If your package (or any package you rely on, e.g. gettext-runtime)
     will be relocated together with a set of installed shared
     libraries, then set 'RELOCATABLE_LIBRARY_PATH' to a colon-separated
     list of those libraries' directories, e.g.
          RELOCATABLE_LIBRARY_PATH = $(libdir)

     If your 'config.h' is not in '$(top_builddir)', then set
     'RELOCATABLE_CONFIG_H_DIR' to its directory, e.g.
          RELOCATABLE_CONFIG_H_DIR = $(top_builddir)/src

15.20 func
==========

   The 'func' module makes sure that you can use the predefined
identifier '__func__' as defined by C99 in your code.

   A small example is:

     #include <config.h>
     #include <stdio.h> /* for printf */

     int main (void)
     {
         printf ("%s: hello world\n", __func__);
     }

   Note that 'sizeof' cannot be applied to '__func__': On SunPRO C
compiler, 'sizeof __func__' evaluates to 0.

15.21 stat-size
===============

   The 'stat-size' module provides a small number of macros intended for
interpreting the file size information in an instance of 'struct stat'.

   On POSIX systems, the 'st_blocks' member of 'struct stat' contains
the number of disk blocks occupied by a file.  The 'ST_NBLOCKS' macro is
used to estimate this quantity on systems which don't actually have
'st_blocks'.  Each of these blocks contains 'ST_NBLOCKSIZE' bytes.

   The value of 'ST_NBLOCKSIZE' is often quite small, small enough that
performing I/O in chunks that size would be inefficient.  'ST_BLKSIZE'
is the I/O block size recommended for I/O to this file.  This is not
guaranteed to give optimum performance, but it should be reasonably
efficient.

16 Regular expressions
**********************

16.1 Overview
=============

   A "regular expression" (or "regexp", or "pattern") is a text string
that describes some (mathematical) set of strings.  A regexp R "matches"
a string S if S is in the set of strings described by R.

   Using the Regex library, you can:

   * see if a string matches a specified pattern as a whole, and

   * search within a string for a substring matching a specified
     pattern.

   Some regular expressions match only one string, i.e., the set they
describe has only one member.  For example, the regular expression 'foo'
matches the string 'foo' and no others.  Other regular expressions match
more than one string, i.e., the set they describe has more than one
member.  For example, the regular expression 'f*' matches the set of
strings made up of any number (including zero) of 'f's.  As you can see,
some characters in regular expressions match themselves (such as 'f')
and some don't (such as '*'); the ones that don't match themselves
instead let you specify patterns that describe many different strings.

   To either match or search for a regular expression with the Regex
library functions, you must first compile it with a Regex pattern
compiling function.  A "compiled pattern" is a regular expression
converted to the internal format used by the library functions.  Once
you've compiled a pattern, you can use it for matching or searching any
number of times.

   The Regex library is used by including 'regex.h'.  Regex provides
three groups of functions with which you can operate on regular
expressions.  One group--the GNU group--is more powerful but not
completely compatible with the other two, namely the POSIX and Berkeley
Unix groups; its interface was designed specifically for GNU.

   We wrote this chapter with programmers in mind, not users of
programs--such as Emacs--that use Regex.  We describe the Regex library
in its entirety, not how to write regular expressions that a particular
program understands.

16.2 Regular Expression Syntax
==============================

   "Characters" are things you can type.  "Operators" are things in a
regular expression that match one or more characters.  You compose
regular expressions from operators, which in turn you specify using one
or more characters.

   Most characters represent what we call the match-self operator, i.e.,
they match themselves; we call these characters "ordinary".  Other
characters represent either all or parts of fancier operators; e.g., '.'
represents what we call the match-any-character operator (which, no
surprise, matches (almost) any character); we call these characters
"special".  Two different things determine what characters represent
what operators:

  1. the regular expression syntax your program has told the Regex
     library to recognize, and

  2. the context of the character in the regular expression.

   In the following sections, we describe these things in more detail.

16.2.1 Syntax Bits
------------------

   In any particular syntax for regular expressions, some characters are
always special, others are sometimes special, and others are never
special.  The particular syntax that Regex recognizes for a given
regular expression depends on the current syntax (as set by
're_set_syntax') when the pattern buffer of that regular expression was
compiled.

   You get a pattern buffer by compiling a regular expression.  *Note
GNU Pattern Buffers::, for more information on pattern buffers.  *Note
GNU Regular Expression Compiling::, and *note BSD Regular Expression
Compiling::, for more information on compiling.

   Regex considers the current syntax to be a collection of bits; we
refer to these bits as "syntax bits".  In most cases, they affect what
characters represent what operators.  We describe the meanings of the
operators to which we refer in *note Common Operators::, *note GNU
Operators::, and *note GNU Emacs Operators::.

   For reference, here is the complete list of syntax bits, in
alphabetical order:

'RE_BACKSLASH_ESCAPE_IN_LISTS'
     If this bit is set, then '\' inside a list (*note List Operators::
     quotes (makes ordinary, if it's special) the following character;
     if this bit isn't set, then '\' is an ordinary character inside
     lists.  (*Note The Backslash Character::, for what '\' does outside
     of lists.)

'RE_BK_PLUS_QM'
     If this bit is set, then '\+' represents the match-one-or-more
     operator and '\?' represents the match-zero-or-more operator; if
     this bit isn't set, then '+' represents the match-one-or-more
     operator and '?' represents the match-zero-or-one operator.  This
     bit is irrelevant if 'RE_LIMITED_OPS' is set.

'RE_CHAR_CLASSES'
     If this bit is set, then you can use character classes in lists; if
     this bit isn't set, then you can't.

'RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_ANCHORS'
     If this bit is set, then '^' and '$' are special anywhere outside a
     list; if this bit isn't set, then these characters are special only
     in certain contexts.  *Note Match-beginning-of-line Operator::, and
     *note Match-end-of-line Operator::.

'RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_OPS'
     If this bit is set, then certain characters are special anywhere
     outside a list; if this bit isn't set, then those characters are
     special only in some contexts and are ordinary elsewhere.
     Specifically, if this bit isn't set then '*', and (if the syntax
     bit 'RE_LIMITED_OPS' isn't set) '+' and '?' (or '\+' and '\?',
     depending on the syntax bit 'RE_BK_PLUS_QM') represent repetition
     operators only if they're not first in a regular expression or just
     after an open-group or alternation operator.  The same holds for
     '{' (or '\{', depending on the syntax bit 'RE_NO_BK_BRACES') if it
     is the beginning of a valid interval and the syntax bit
     'RE_INTERVALS' is set.

'RE_CONTEXT_INVALID_DUP'
     If this bit is set, then an open-interval operator cannot occur at
     the start of a regular expression, or immediately after an
     alternation, open-group or close-interval operator.

'RE_CONTEXT_INVALID_OPS'
     If this bit is set, then repetition and alternation operators can't
     be in certain positions within a regular expression.  Specifically,
     the regular expression is invalid if it has:

        * a repetition operator first in the regular expression or just
          after a match-beginning-of-line, open-group, or alternation
          operator; or

        * an alternation operator first or last in the regular
          expression, just before a match-end-of-line operator, or just
          after an alternation or open-group operator.

     If this bit isn't set, then you can put the characters representing
     the repetition and alternation characters anywhere in a regular
     expression.  Whether or not they will in fact be operators in
     certain positions depends on other syntax bits.

'RE_DEBUG'
     If this bit is set, and the regex library was compiled with
     '-DDEBUG', then internal debugging is turned on; if unset, then it
     is turned off.

'RE_DOT_NEWLINE'
     If this bit is set, then the match-any-character operator matches a
     newline; if this bit isn't set, then it doesn't.

'RE_DOT_NOT_NULL'
     If this bit is set, then the match-any-character operator doesn't
     match a null character; if this bit isn't set, then it does.

'RE_HAT_LISTS_NOT_NEWLINE'
     If this bit is set, nonmatching lists '[^...]' do not match
     newline; if not set, they do.

'RE_ICASE'
     If this bit is set, then ignore case when matching; otherwise, case
     is significant.

'RE_INTERVALS'
     If this bit is set, then Regex recognizes interval operators; if
     this bit isn't set, then it doesn't.

'RE_INVALID_INTERVAL_ORD'
     If this bit is set, a syntactically invalid interval is treated as
     a string of ordinary characters.  For example, the extended regular
     expression 'a{1' is treated as 'a\{1'.

'RE_LIMITED_OPS'
     If this bit is set, then Regex doesn't recognize the
     match-one-or-more, match-zero-or-one or alternation operators; if
     this bit isn't set, then it does.

'RE_NEWLINE_ALT'
     If this bit is set, then newline represents the alternation
     operator; if this bit isn't set, then newline is ordinary.

'RE_NO_BK_BRACES'
     If this bit is set, then '{' represents the open-interval operator
     and '}' represents the close-interval operator; if this bit isn't
     set, then '\{' represents the open-interval operator and '\}'
     represents the close-interval operator.  This bit is relevant only
     if 'RE_INTERVALS' is set.

'RE_NO_BK_PARENS'
     If this bit is set, then '(' represents the open-group operator and
     ')' represents the close-group operator; if this bit isn't set,
     then '\(' represents the open-group operator and '\)' represents
     the close-group operator.

'RE_NO_BK_REFS'
     If this bit is set, then Regex doesn't recognize '\'DIGIT as the
     back-reference operator; if this bit isn't set, then it does.

'RE_NO_BK_VBAR'
     If this bit is set, then '|' represents the alternation operator;
     if this bit isn't set, then '\|' represents the alternation
     operator.  This bit is irrelevant if 'RE_LIMITED_OPS' is set.

'RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES'
     If this bit is set, then a regular expression with a range whose
     ending point collates lower than its starting point is invalid; if
     this bit isn't set, then Regex considers such a range to be empty.

'RE_NO_GNU_OPS'
     If this bit is set, GNU regex operators are not recognized;
     otherwise, they are.

'RE_NO_POSIX_BACKTRACKING'
     If this bit is set, succeed as soon as we match the whole pattern,
     without further backtracking.  This means that a match may not be
     the leftmost longest; *note What Gets Matched?:: for what this
     means.

'RE_NO_SUB'
     If this bit is set, then 'no_sub' will be set to one during
     're_compile_pattern'.  This causes matching and searching routines
     not to record substring match information.

'RE_UNMATCHED_RIGHT_PAREN_ORD'
     If this bit is set and the regular expression has no matching
     open-group operator, then Regex considers what would otherwise be a
     close-group operator (based on how 'RE_NO_BK_PARENS' is set) to
     match ')'.

16.2.2 Predefined Syntaxes
--------------------------

   If you're programming with Regex, you can set a pattern buffer's
(*note GNU Pattern Buffers::) syntax either to an arbitrary combination
of syntax bits (*note Syntax Bits::) or else to the configurations
defined by Regex.  These configurations define the syntaxes used by
certain programs--GNU Emacs, POSIX Awk, traditional Awk, Grep, Egrep--in
addition to syntaxes for POSIX basic and extended regular expressions.

   The predefined syntaxes--taken directly from 'regex.h'--are:

     #define RE_SYNTAX_EMACS 0

     #define RE_SYNTAX_AWK                                                   \

        isn't minimal, since other operators, such as \`, aren't disabled.  */
     #define RE_SYNTAX_POSIX_MINIMAL_BASIC                                   \

        | RE_NO_BK_VBAR          | RE_UNMATCHED_RIGHT_PAREN_ORD)

16.2.3 Collating Elements vs. Characters
----------------------------------------

   POSIX generalizes the notion of a character to that of a collating
element.  It defines a "collating element" to be "a sequence of one or
more bytes defined in the current collating sequence as a unit of
collation."

   This generalizes the notion of a character in two ways.  First, a
single character can map into two or more collating elements.  For
example, the German "es-zet" collates as the collating element 's'
followed by another collating element 's'.  Second, two or more
characters can map into one collating element.  For example, the Spanish
'll' collates after 'l' and before 'm'.

   Since POSIX's "collating element" preserves the essential idea of a
"character," we use the latter, more familiar, term in this document.

16.2.4 The Backslash Character
------------------------------

   The '\' character has one of four different meanings, depending on
the context in which you use it and what syntax bits are set (*note
Syntax Bits::).  It can: 1) stand for itself, 2) quote the next
character, 3) introduce an operator, or 4) do nothing.

  1. It stands for itself inside a list (*note List Operators::) if the
     syntax bit 'RE_BACKSLASH_ESCAPE_IN_LISTS' is not set.  For example,
     '[\]' would match '\'.

  2. It quotes (makes ordinary, if it's special) the next character when
     you use it either:

        * outside a list,(1) or

        * inside a list and the syntax bit
          'RE_BACKSLASH_ESCAPE_IN_LISTS' is set.

  3. It introduces an operator when followed by certain ordinary
     characters--sometimes only when certain syntax bits are set.  See
     the cases 'RE_BK_PLUS_QM', 'RE_NO_BK_BRACES', 'RE_NO_BK_VAR',
     'RE_NO_BK_PARENS', 'RE_NO_BK_REF' in *note Syntax Bits::.  Also:

        * '\b' represents the match-word-boundary operator (*note
          Match-word-boundary Operator::).

        * '\B' represents the match-within-word operator (*note
          Match-within-word Operator::).

        * '\<' represents the match-beginning-of-word operator
          (*note Match-beginning-of-word Operator::).

        * '\>' represents the match-end-of-word operator (*note
          Match-end-of-word Operator::).

        * '\w' represents the match-word-constituent operator (*note
          Match-word-constituent Operator::).

        * '\W' represents the match-non-word-constituent operator (*note
          Match-non-word-constituent Operator::).

        * '\`' represents the match-beginning-of-buffer operator and
          '\'' represents the match-end-of-buffer operator (*note Buffer
          Operators::).

        * If Regex was compiled with the C preprocessor symbol 'emacs'
          defined, then '\sCLASS' represents the match-syntactic-class
          operator and '\SCLASS' represents the
          match-not-syntactic-class operator (*note Syntactic Class
          Operators::).

  4. In all other cases, Regex ignores '\'.  For example, '\n' matches
     'n'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Sometimes you don't have to explicitly quote special characters
to make them ordinary.  For instance, most characters lose any special
meaning inside a list (*note List Operators::).  In addition, if the
syntax bits 'RE_CONTEXT_INVALID_OPS' and 'RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_OPS' aren't
set, then (for historical reasons) the matcher considers special
characters ordinary if they are in contexts where the operations they
represent make no sense; for example, then the match-zero-or-more
operator (represented by '*') matches itself in the regular expression
'*foo' because there is no preceding expression on which it can operate.
It is poor practice, however, to depend on this behavior; if you want a
special character to be ordinary outside a list, it's better to always
quote it, regardless.

16.3 Common Operators
=====================

   You compose regular expressions from operators.  In the following
sections, we describe the regular expression operators specified by
POSIX; GNU also uses these.  Most operators have more than one
representation as characters.  *Note Regular Expression Syntax::, for
what characters represent what operators under what circumstances.

   For most operators that can be represented in two ways, one
representation is a single character and the other is that character
preceded by '\'.  For example, either '(' or '\(' represents the
open-group operator.  Which one does depends on the setting of a syntax
bit, in this case 'RE_NO_BK_PARENS'.  Why is this so?  Historical
reasons dictate some of the varying representations, while POSIX
dictates others.

   Finally, almost all characters lose any special meaning inside a list
(*note List Operators::).

16.3.1 The Match-self Operator (ORDINARY CHARACTER)
---------------------------------------------------

   This operator matches the character itself.  All ordinary characters
(*note Regular Expression Syntax::) represent this operator.  For
example, 'f' is always an ordinary character, so the regular expression
'f' matches only the string 'f'.  In particular, it does _not_ match the
string 'ff'.

16.3.2 The Match-any-character Operator ('.')
---------------------------------------------

   This operator matches any single printing or nonprinting character
except it won't match a:

newline
     if the syntax bit 'RE_DOT_NEWLINE' isn't set.

null
     if the syntax bit 'RE_DOT_NOT_NULL' is set.

   The '.' (period) character represents this operator.  For example,
'a.b' matches any three-character string beginning with 'a' and ending
with 'b'.

16.3.3 The Concatenation Operator
---------------------------------

   This operator concatenates two regular expressions A and B.  No
character represents this operator; you simply put B after A.  The
result is a regular expression that will match a string if A matches its
first part and B matches the rest.  For example, 'xy' (two match-self
operators) matches 'xy'.

16.3.4 Repetition Operators
---------------------------

   Repetition operators repeat the preceding regular expression a
specified number of times.

16.3.4.1 The Match-zero-or-more Operator ('*')
..............................................

   This operator repeats the smallest possible preceding regular
expression as many times as necessary (including zero) to match the
pattern.  '*' represents this operator.  For example, 'o*' matches any
string made up of zero or more 'o's.  Since this operator operates on
the smallest preceding regular expression, 'fo*' has a repeating 'o',
not a repeating 'fo'.  So, 'fo*' matches 'f', 'fo', 'foo', and so on.

   Since the match-zero-or-more operator is a suffix operator, it may be
useless as such when no regular expression precedes it.  This is the
case when it:

   * is first in a regular expression, or

   * follows a match-beginning-of-line, open-group, or alternation
     operator.

Three different things can happen in these cases:

  1. If the syntax bit 'RE_CONTEXT_INVALID_OPS' is set, then the regular
     expression is invalid.

  2. If 'RE_CONTEXT_INVALID_OPS' isn't set, but 'RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_OPS'
     is, then '*' represents the match-zero-or-more operator (which then
     operates on the empty string).

  3. Otherwise, '*' is ordinary.

   The matcher processes a match-zero-or-more operator by first matching
as many repetitions of the smallest preceding regular expression as it
can.  Then it continues to match the rest of the pattern.

   If it can't match the rest of the pattern, it backtracks (as many
times as necessary), each time discarding one of the matches until it
can either match the entire pattern or be certain that it cannot get a
match.  For example, when matching 'ca*ar' against 'caaar', the matcher
first matches all three 'a's of the string with the 'a*' of the regular
expression.  However, it cannot then match the final 'ar' of the regular
expression against the final 'r' of the string.  So it backtracks,
discarding the match of the last 'a' in the string.  It can then match
the remaining 'ar'.

16.3.4.2 The Match-one-or-more Operator ('+' or '\+')
.....................................................

   If the syntax bit 'RE_LIMITED_OPS' is set, then Regex doesn't
recognize this operator.  Otherwise, if the syntax bit 'RE_BK_PLUS_QM'
isn't set, then '+' represents this operator; if it is, then '\+' does.

   This operator is similar to the match-zero-or-more operator except
that it repeats the preceding regular expression at least once; *note
Match-zero-or-more Operator::, for what it operates on, how some syntax
bits affect it, and how Regex backtracks to match it.

   For example, supposing that '+' represents the match-one-or-more
operator; then 'ca+r' matches, e.g., 'car' and 'caaaar', but not 'cr'.

16.3.4.3 The Match-zero-or-one Operator ('?' or '\?')
.....................................................

   If the syntax bit 'RE_LIMITED_OPS' is set, then Regex doesn't
recognize this operator.  Otherwise, if the syntax bit 'RE_BK_PLUS_QM'
isn't set, then '?' represents this operator; if it is, then '\?' does.

   This operator is similar to the match-zero-or-more operator except
that it repeats the preceding regular expression once or not at all;
*note Match-zero-or-more Operator::, to see what it operates on, how
some syntax bits affect it, and how Regex backtracks to match it.

   For example, supposing that '?' represents the match-zero-or-one
operator; then 'ca?r' matches both 'car' and 'cr', but nothing else.

16.3.4.4 Interval Operators ('{' ... '}' or '\{' ... '\}')
..........................................................

   If the syntax bit 'RE_INTERVALS' is set, then Regex recognizes
"interval expressions".  They repeat the smallest possible preceding
regular expression a specified number of times.

   If the syntax bit 'RE_NO_BK_BRACES' is set, '{' represents the
"open-interval operator" and '}' represents the "close-interval
operator" ; otherwise, '\{' and '\}' do.

   Specifically, supposing that '{' and '}' represent the open-interval
and close-interval operators; then:

'{COUNT}'
     matches exactly COUNT occurrences of the preceding regular
     expression.

'{MIN,}'
     matches MIN or more occurrences of the preceding regular
     expression.

'{MIN, MAX}'
     matches at least MIN but no more than MAX occurrences of the
     preceding regular expression.

   The interval expression (but not necessarily the regular expression
that contains it) is invalid if:

   * MIN is greater than MAX, or

   * any of COUNT, MIN, or MAX are outside the range zero to
     'RE_DUP_MAX' (which symbol 'regex.h' defines).

   If the interval expression is invalid and the syntax bit
'RE_NO_BK_BRACES' is set, then Regex considers all the characters in the
would-be interval to be ordinary.  If that bit isn't set, then the
regular expression is invalid.

   If the interval expression is valid but there is no preceding regular
expression on which to operate, then if the syntax bit
'RE_CONTEXT_INVALID_OPS' is set, the regular expression is invalid.  If
that bit isn't set, then Regex considers all the characters--other than
backslashes, which it ignores--in the would-be interval to be ordinary.

16.3.5 The Alternation Operator ('|' or '\|')
---------------------------------------------

   If the syntax bit 'RE_LIMITED_OPS' is set, then Regex doesn't
recognize this operator.  Otherwise, if the syntax bit 'RE_NO_BK_VBAR'
is set, then '|' represents this operator; otherwise, '\|' does.

   Alternatives match one of a choice of regular expressions: if you put
the character(s) representing the alternation operator between any two
regular expressions A and B, the result matches the union of the strings
that A and B match.  For example, supposing that '|' is the alternation
operator, then 'foo|bar|quux' would match any of 'foo', 'bar' or 'quux'.

   The alternation operator operates on the _largest_ possible
surrounding regular expressions.  (Put another way, it has the lowest
precedence of any regular expression operator.)  Thus, the only way you
can delimit its arguments is to use grouping.  For example, if '(' and
')' are the open and close-group operators, then 'fo(o|b)ar' would match
either 'fooar' or 'fobar'.  ('foo|bar' would match 'foo' or 'bar'.)

   The matcher usually tries all combinations of alternatives so as to
match the longest possible string.  For example, when matching
'(fooq|foo)*(qbarquux|bar)' against 'fooqbarquux', it cannot take, say,
the first ("depth-first") combination it could match, since then it
would be content to match just 'fooqbar'.

   Note that since the default behavior is to return the leftmost
longest match, when more than one of a series of alternatives matches
the actual match will be the longest matching alternative, not
necessarily the first in the list.

16.3.6 List Operators ('[' ... ']' and '[^' ... ']')
----------------------------------------------------

   "Lists", also called "bracket expressions", are a set of one or more
items.  An "item" is a character, a collating symbol, an equivalence
class expression, a character class expression, or a range expression.
The syntax bits affect which kinds of items you can put in a list.  We
explain the last four items in subsections below.  Empty lists are
invalid.

   A "matching list" matches a single character represented by one of
the list items.  You form a matching list by enclosing one or more items
within an "open-matching-list operator" (represented by '[') and a
"close-list operator" (represented by ']').

   For example, '[ab]' matches either 'a' or 'b'.  '[ad]*' matches the
empty string and any string composed of just 'a's and 'd's in any order.
Regex considers invalid a regular expression with a '[' but no matching
']'.

   "Nonmatching lists" are similar to matching lists except that they
match a single character _not_ represented by one of the list items.
You use an "open-nonmatching-list operator" (represented by '[^'(1))
instead of an open-matching-list operator to start a nonmatching list.

   For example, '[^ab]' matches any character except 'a' or 'b'.

   If the syntax bit 'RE_HAT_LISTS_NOT_NEWLINE' is set, then nonmatching
lists do not match a newline.

   Most characters lose any special meaning inside a list.  The special
characters inside a list follow.

']'
     ends the list if it's not the first list item.  So, if you want to
     make the ']' character a list item, you must put it first.

'\'
     quotes the next character if the syntax bit
     'RE_BACKSLASH_ESCAPE_IN_LISTS' is set.

'[.'
     represents the open-collating-symbol operator (*note Collating
     Symbol Operators::).

'.]'
     represents the close-collating-symbol operator.

'[='
     represents the open-equivalence-class operator (*note Equivalence
     Class Operators::).

'=]'
     represents the close-equivalence-class operator.

'[:'
     represents the open-character-class operator (*note Character Class
     Operators::) if the syntax bit 'RE_CHAR_CLASSES' is set and what
     follows is a valid character class expression.

':]'
     represents the close-character-class operator if the syntax bit
     'RE_CHAR_CLASSES' is set and what precedes it is an
     open-character-class operator followed by a valid character class
     name.

'-'
     represents the range operator (*note Range Operator::) if it's not
     first or last in a list or the ending point of a range.

All other characters are ordinary.  For example, '[.*]' matches '.' and
'*'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Regex therefore doesn't consider the '^' to be the first
character in the list.  If you put a '^' character first in (what you
think is) a matching list, you'll turn it into a nonmatching list.

16.3.6.1 Collating Symbol Operators ('[.' ... '.]')
...................................................

   Collating symbols can be represented inside lists.  You form a
"collating symbol" by putting a collating element between an
"open-collating-symbol operator" and a "close-collating-symbol
operator".  '[.' represents the open-collating-symbol operator and '.]'
represents the close-collating-symbol operator.  For example, if 'll' is
a collating element, then '[[.ll.]]' would match 'll'.

16.3.6.2 Equivalence Class Operators ('[=' ... '=]')
....................................................

   Regex recognizes equivalence class expressions inside lists.  A
"equivalence class expression" is a set of collating elements which all
belong to the same equivalence class.  You form an equivalence class
expression by putting a collating element between an
"open-equivalence-class operator" and a "close-equivalence-class
operator".  '[=' represents the open-equivalence-class operator and '=]'
represents the close-equivalence-class operator.  For example, if 'a'
and 'A' were an equivalence class, then both '[[=a=]]' and '[[=A=]]'
would match both 'a' and 'A'.  If the collating element in an
equivalence class expression isn't part of an equivalence class, then
the matcher considers the equivalence class expression to be a collating
symbol.

16.3.6.3 Character Class Operators ('[:' ... ':]')
..................................................

   If the syntax bit 'RE_CHAR_CLASSES' is set, then Regex recognizes
character class expressions inside lists.  A "character class
expression" matches one character from a given class.  You form a
character class expression by putting a character class name between an
"open-character-class operator" (represented by '[:') and a
"close-character-class operator" (represented by ':]').  The character
class names and their meanings are:

'alnum'
     letters and digits

'alpha'
     letters

'blank'
     system-dependent; for GNU, a space or tab

'cntrl'
     control characters (in the ASCII encoding, code 0177 and codes less
     than 040)

'digit'
     digits

'graph'
     same as 'print' except omits space

'lower'
     lowercase letters

'print'
     printable characters (in the ASCII encoding, space tilde--codes 040
     through 0176)

'punct'
     neither control nor alphanumeric characters

'space'
     space, carriage return, newline, vertical tab, and form feed

'upper'
     uppercase letters

'xdigit'
     hexadecimal digits: '0'-'9', 'a'-'f', 'A'-'F'

These correspond to the definitions in the C library's '<ctype.h>'
facility.  For example, '[:alpha:]' corresponds to the standard facility
'isalpha'.  Regex recognizes character class expressions only inside of
lists; so '[[:alpha:]]' matches any letter, but '[:alpha:]' outside of a
bracket expression and not followed by a repetition operator matches
just itself.

16.3.6.4 The Range Operator ('-')
.................................

   Regex recognizes "range expressions" inside a list.  They represent
those characters that fall between two elements in the current collating
sequence.  You form a range expression by putting a "range operator"
between two of any of the following: characters, collating elements,
collating symbols, and equivalence class expressions.  The starting
point of the range and the ending point of the range don't have to be
the same kind of item, e.g., the starting point could be a collating
element and the ending point could be an equivalence class expression.
If a range's ending point is an equivalence class, then all the
collating elements in that class will be in the range.(1)  '-'
represents the range operator.  For example, 'a-f' within a list
represents all the characters from 'a' through 'f' inclusively.

   If the syntax bit 'RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES' is set, then if the range's
ending point collates less than its starting point, the range (and the
regular expression containing it) is invalid.  For example, the regular
expression '[z-a]' would be invalid.  If this bit isn't set, then Regex
considers such a range to be empty.

   Since '-' represents the range operator, if you want to make a '-'
character itself a list item, you must do one of the following:

   * Put the '-' either first or last in the list.

   * Include a range whose starting point collates strictly lower than
     '-' and whose ending point collates equal or higher.  Unless a
     range is the first item in a list, a '-' can't be its starting
     point, but _can_ be its ending point.  That is because Regex
     considers '-' to be the range operator unless it is preceded by
     another '-'.  For example, in the ASCII encoding, ')', '*', '+',
     ',', '-', '.', and '/' are contiguous characters in the collating
     sequence.  You might think that '[)-+--/]' has two ranges: ')-+'
     and '--/'.  Rather, it has the ranges ')-+' and '+--', plus the
     character '/', so it matches, e.g., ',', not '.'.

   * Put a range whose starting point is '-' first in the list.

   For example, '[-a-z]' matches a lowercase letter or a hyphen (in
English, in ASCII).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can't use a character class for the starting or ending point
of a range, since a character class is not a single character.

16.3.7 Grouping Operators ('(' ... ')' or '\(' ... '\)')
--------------------------------------------------------

   A "group", also known as a "subexpression", consists of an
"open-group operator", any number of other operators, and a "close-group
operator".  Regex treats this sequence as a unit, just as mathematics
and programming languages treat a parenthesized expression as a unit.

   Therefore, using "groups", you can:

   * delimit the argument(s) to an alternation operator (*note
     Alternation Operator::) or a repetition operator (*note Repetition
     Operators::).

   * keep track of the indices of the substring that matched a given
     group.  *Note Using Registers::, for a precise explanation.  This
     lets you:

        * use the back-reference operator (*note Back-reference
          Operator::).

        * use registers (*note Using Registers::).

   If the syntax bit 'RE_NO_BK_PARENS' is set, then '(' represents the
open-group operator and ')' represents the close-group operator;
otherwise, '\(' and '\)' do.

   If the syntax bit 'RE_UNMATCHED_RIGHT_PAREN_ORD' is set and a
close-group operator has no matching open-group operator, then Regex
considers it to match ')'.

16.3.8 The Back-reference Operator ("\"DIGIT)
---------------------------------------------

   If the syntax bit 'RE_NO_BK_REF' isn't set, then Regex recognizes
back-references.  A back-reference matches a specified preceding group.
The back-reference operator is represented by '\DIGIT' anywhere after
the end of a regular expression's DIGIT-th group (*note Grouping
Operators::).

   DIGIT must be between '1' and '9'.  The matcher assigns numbers 1
through 9 to the first nine groups it encounters.  By using one of '\1'
through '\9' after the corresponding group's close-group operator, you
can match a substring identical to the one that the group does.

   Back-references match according to the following (in all examples
below, '(' represents the open-group, ')' the close-group, '{' the
open-interval and '}' the close-interval operator):

   * If the group matches a substring, the back-reference matches an
     identical substring.  For example, '(a)\1' matches 'aa' and
     '(bana)na\1bo\1' matches 'bananabanabobana'.  Likewise, '(.*)\1'
     matches any (newline-free if the syntax bit 'RE_DOT_NEWLINE' isn't
     set) string that is composed of two identical halves; the '(.*)'
     matches the first half and the '\1' matches the second half.

   * If the group matches more than once (as it might if followed by,
     e.g., a repetition operator), then the back-reference matches the
     substring the group _last_ matched.  For example, '((a*)b)*\1\2'
     matches 'aabababa'; first group 1 (the outer one) matches 'aab' and
     group 2 (the inner one) matches 'aa'.  Then group 1 matches 'ab'
     and group 2 matches 'a'.  So, '\1' matches 'ab' and '\2' matches
     'a'.

   * If the group doesn't participate in a match, i.e., it is part of an
     alternative not taken or a repetition operator allows zero
     repetitions of it, then the back-reference makes the whole match
     fail.  For example, '(one()|two())-and-(three\2|four\3)' matches
     'one-and-three' and 'two-and-four', but not 'one-and-four' or
     'two-and-three'.  For example, if the pattern matches 'one-and-',
     then its group 2 matches the empty string and its group 3 doesn't
     participate in the match.  So, if it then matches 'four', then when
     it tries to back-reference group 3--which it will attempt to do
     because '\3' follows the 'four'--the match will fail because
     group 3 didn't participate in the match.

   You can use a back-reference as an argument to a repetition operator.
For example, '(a(b))\2*' matches 'a' followed by two or more 'b's.
Similarly, '(a(b))\2{3}' matches 'abbbb'.

   If there is no preceding DIGIT-th subexpression, the regular
expression is invalid.

   Back-references can greatly slow down matching, as they can generate
exponentially many matching possibilities that can consume both time and
memory to explore.  Also, the POSIX specification for back-references is
at times unclear.  Furthermore, many regular expression implementations
have back-reference bugs that can cause programs to return incorrect
answers or even crash, and fixing these bugs has often been
low-priority: for example, as of 2020 the GNU C library bug database
(https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/) contained back-reference bugs 52,
10844, 11053, 24269 and 25322, with little sign of forthcoming fixes.
Luckily, back-references are rarely useful and it should be little
trouble to avoid them in practical applications.

16.3.9 Anchoring Operators
--------------------------

   These operators can constrain a pattern to match only at the
beginning or end of the entire string or at the beginning or end of a
line.

16.3.9.1 The Match-beginning-of-line Operator ('^')
...................................................

   This operator can match the empty string either at the beginning of
the string or after a newline character.  Thus, it is said to "anchor"
the pattern to the beginning of a line.

   In the cases following, '^' represents this operator.  (Otherwise,
'^' is ordinary.)

   * It (the '^') is first in the pattern, as in '^foo'.

   * The syntax bit 'RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_ANCHORS' is set, and it is outside
     a bracket expression.

   * It follows an open-group or alternation operator, as in 'a\(^b\)'
     and 'a\|^b'.  *Note Grouping Operators::, and *note Alternation
     Operator::.

   These rules imply that some valid patterns containing '^' cannot be
matched; for example, 'foo^bar' if 'RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_ANCHORS' is set.

   If the 'not_bol' field is set in the pattern buffer (*note GNU
Pattern Buffers::), then '^' fails to match at the beginning of the
string.  This lets you match against pieces of a line, as you would need
to if, say, searching for repeated instances of a given pattern in a
line; it would work correctly for patterns both with and without
match-beginning-of-line operators.

16.3.9.2 The Match-end-of-line Operator ('$')
.............................................

   This operator can match the empty string either at the end of the
string or before a newline character in the string.  Thus, it is said to
"anchor" the pattern to the end of a line.

   It is always represented by '$'.  For example, 'foo$' usually
matches, e.g., 'foo' and, e.g., the first three characters of
'foo\nbar'.

   Its interaction with the syntax bits and pattern buffer fields is
exactly the dual of '^''s; see the previous section.  (That is, "'^'"
becomes "'$'", "beginning" becomes "end", "next" becomes "previous",
"after" becomes "before", and "'not_bol'" becomes "'not_eol'".)

16.4 GNU Operators
==================

   Following are operators that GNU defines (and POSIX doesn't).

16.4.1 Word Operators
---------------------

   The operators in this section require Regex to recognize parts of
words.  Regex uses a syntax table to determine whether or not a
character is part of a word, i.e., whether or not it is
"word-constituent".

16.4.1.1 Non-Emacs Syntax Tables
................................

   A "syntax table" is an array indexed by the characters in your
character set.  In the ASCII encoding, therefore, a syntax table has 256
elements.  Regex always uses a 'char *' variable 're_syntax_table' as
its syntax table.  In some cases, it initializes this variable and in
others it expects you to initialize it.

   * If Regex is compiled with the preprocessor symbols 'emacs' and
     'SYNTAX_TABLE' both undefined, then Regex allocates
     're_syntax_table' and initializes an element I either to 'Sword'
     (which it defines) if I is a letter, number, or '_', or to zero if
     it's not.

   * If Regex is compiled with 'emacs' undefined but 'SYNTAX_TABLE'
     defined, then Regex expects you to define a 'char *' variable
     're_syntax_table' to be a valid syntax table.

   * *Note Emacs Syntax Tables::, for what happens when Regex is
     compiled with the preprocessor symbol 'emacs' defined.

16.4.1.2 The Match-word-boundary Operator ('\b')
................................................

   This operator (represented by '\b') matches the empty string at
either the beginning or the end of a word.  For example, '\brat\b'
matches the separate word 'rat'.

16.4.1.3 The Match-within-word Operator ('\B')
..............................................

   This operator (represented by '\B') matches the empty string within a
word.  For example, 'c\Brat\Be' matches 'crate', but 'dirty \Brat'
doesn't match 'dirty rat'.

16.4.1.4 The Match-beginning-of-word Operator ('\<')
....................................................

   This operator (represented by '\<') matches the empty string at the
beginning of a word.

16.4.1.5 The Match-end-of-word Operator ('\>')
..............................................

   This operator (represented by '\>') matches the empty string at the
end of a word.

16.4.1.6 The Match-word-constituent Operator ('\w')
...................................................

   This operator (represented by '\w') matches any word-constituent
character.

16.4.1.7 The Match-non-word-constituent Operator ('\W')
.......................................................

   This operator (represented by '\W') matches any character that is not
word-constituent.

16.4.2 Buffer Operators
-----------------------

   Following are operators which work on buffers.  In Emacs, a "buffer"
is, naturally, an Emacs buffer.  For other programs, Regex considers the
entire string to be matched as the buffer.

16.4.2.1 The Match-beginning-of-buffer Operator ('\`')
......................................................

   This operator (represented by '\`') matches the empty string at the
beginning of the buffer.

16.4.2.2 The Match-end-of-buffer Operator ('\'')
................................................

   This operator (represented by '\'') matches the empty string at the
end of the buffer.

16.5 GNU Emacs Operators
========================

   Following are operators that GNU defines (and POSIX doesn't) that you
can use only when Regex is compiled with the preprocessor symbol 'emacs'
defined.

16.5.1 Syntactic Class Operators
--------------------------------

   The operators in this section require Regex to recognize the
syntactic classes of characters.  Regex uses a syntax table to determine
this.

16.5.1.1 Emacs Syntax Tables
............................

   A "syntax table" is an array indexed by the characters in your
character set.  In the ASCII encoding, therefore, a syntax table has 256
elements.

   If Regex is compiled with the preprocessor symbol 'emacs' defined,
then Regex expects you to define and initialize the variable
're_syntax_table' to be an Emacs syntax table.  Emacs' syntax tables are
more complicated than Regex's own (*note Non-Emacs Syntax Tables::).
*Note Syntax: (emacs)Syntax, for a description of Emacs' syntax tables.

16.5.1.2 The Match-syntactic-class Operator ('\s'CLASS)
.......................................................

   This operator matches any character whose syntactic class is
represented by a specified character.  '\sCLASS' represents this
operator where CLASS is the character representing the syntactic class
you want.  For example, 'w' represents the syntactic class of
word-constituent characters, so '\sw' matches any word-constituent
character.

16.5.1.3 The Match-not-syntactic-class Operator ('\S'CLASS)
...........................................................

   This operator is similar to the match-syntactic-class operator except
that it matches any character whose syntactic class is _not_ represented
by the specified character.  '\SCLASS' represents this operator.  For
example, 'w' represents the syntactic class of word-constituent
characters, so '\Sw' matches any character that is not word-constituent.

16.6 What Gets Matched?
=======================

   Regex usually matches strings according to the "leftmost longest"
rule; that is, it chooses the longest of the leftmost matches.  This
does not mean that for a regular expression containing subexpressions
that it simply chooses the longest match for each subexpression, left to
right; the overall match must also be the longest possible one.

   For example, '(ac*)(c*d[ac]*)\1' matches 'acdacaaa', not 'acdac', as
it would if it were to choose the longest match for the first
subexpression.

16.7 Programming with Regex
===========================

   Here we describe how you use the Regex data structures and functions
in C programs.  Regex has three interfaces: one designed for GNU, one
compatible with POSIX (as specified by POSIX, draft 1003.2/D11.2), and
one compatible with Berkeley Unix.  The POSIX interface is not
documented here; see the documentation of GNU libc, or the POSIX man
pages.  The Berkeley Unix interface is documented here for convenience,
since its documentation is not otherwise readily available on GNU
systems.

16.7.1 GNU Regex Functions
--------------------------

   If you're writing code that doesn't need to be compatible with either
POSIX or Berkeley Unix, you can use these functions.  They provide more
options than the other interfaces.

16.7.1.1 GNU Pattern Buffers
............................

   To compile, match, or search for a given regular expression, you must
supply a pattern buffer.  A "pattern buffer" holds one compiled regular
expression.(1)

   You can have several different pattern buffers simultaneously, each
holding a compiled pattern for a different regular expression.

   'regex.h' defines the pattern buffer 'struct' with the following
public fields:

       unsigned char *buffer;
       unsigned long allocated;
       char *fastmap;
       char *translate;
       size_t re_nsub;
       unsigned no_sub : 1;
       unsigned not_bol : 1;
       unsigned not_eol : 1;

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Regular expressions are also referred to as "patterns," hence the
name "pattern buffer."

16.7.1.2 GNU Regular Expression Compiling
.........................................

   In GNU, you can both match and search for a given regular expression.
To do either, you must first compile it in a pattern buffer (*note GNU
Pattern Buffers::).

   Regular expressions match according to the syntax with which they
were compiled; with GNU, you indicate what syntax you want by setting
the variable 're_syntax_options' (declared in 'regex.h') before calling
the compiling function, 're_compile_pattern' (see below).  *Note Syntax
Bits::, and *note Predefined Syntaxes::.

   You can change the value of 're_syntax_options' at any time.
Usually, however, you set its value once and then never change it.

   're_compile_pattern' takes a pattern buffer as an argument.  You must
initialize the following fields:

'translate initialization'

'translate'
     Initialize this to point to a translate table if you want one, or
     to zero if you don't.  We explain translate tables in *note GNU
     Translate Tables::.

'fastmap'
     Initialize this to nonzero if you want a fastmap, or to zero if you
     don't.

'buffer'
'allocated'
     If you want 're_compile_pattern' to allocate memory for the
     compiled pattern, set both of these to zero.  If you have an
     existing block of memory (allocated with 'malloc') you want Regex
     to use, set 'buffer' to its address and 'allocated' to its size (in
     bytes).

     're_compile_pattern' uses 'realloc' to extend the space for the
     compiled pattern as necessary.

   To compile a pattern buffer, use:

     char *
     re_compile_pattern (const char *REGEX, const int REGEX_SIZE,
                         struct re_pattern_buffer *PATTERN_BUFFER)

REGEX is the regular expression's address, REGEX_SIZE is its length, and
PATTERN_BUFFER is the pattern buffer's address.

   If 're_compile_pattern' successfully compiles the regular expression,
it returns zero and sets '*PATTERN_BUFFER' to the compiled pattern.  It
sets the pattern buffer's fields as follows:

'buffer'
     to the compiled pattern.

'syntax'
     to the current value of 're_syntax_options'.

're_nsub'
     to the number of subexpressions in REGEX.

   If 're_compile_pattern' can't compile REGEX, it returns an error
string corresponding to a POSIX error code.

16.7.1.3 GNU Matching
.....................

   Matching the GNU way means trying to match as much of a string as
possible starting at a position within it you specify.  Once you've
compiled a pattern into a pattern buffer (*note GNU Regular Expression
Compiling::), you can ask the matcher to match that pattern against a
string using:

     int
     re_match (struct re_pattern_buffer *PATTERN_BUFFER,
               const char *STRING, const int SIZE,
               const int START, struct re_registers *REGS)

PATTERN_BUFFER is the address of a pattern buffer containing a compiled
pattern.  STRING is the string you want to match; it can contain newline
and null characters.  SIZE is the length of that string.  START is the
string index at which you want to begin matching; the first character of
STRING is at index zero.  *Note Using Registers::, for an explanation of
REGS; you can safely pass zero.

   're_match' matches the regular expression in PATTERN_BUFFER against
the string STRING according to the syntax of PATTERN_BUFFER.  (*Note GNU
Regular Expression Compiling::, for how to set it.)  The function
returns -1 if the compiled pattern does not match any part of STRING and
-2 if an internal error happens; otherwise, it returns how many
(possibly zero) characters of STRING the pattern matched.

   An example: suppose PATTERN_BUFFER points to a pattern buffer
containing the compiled pattern for 'a*', and STRING points to 'aaaaab'
(whereupon SIZE should be 6).  Then if START is 2, 're_match' returns 3,
i.e., 'a*' would have matched the last three 'a's in STRING.  If START
is 0, 're_match' returns 5, i.e., 'a*' would have matched all the 'a's
in STRING.  If START is either 5 or 6, it returns zero.

   If START is not between zero and SIZE, then 're_match' returns -1.

16.7.1.4 GNU Searching
......................

   "Searching" means trying to match starting at successive positions
within a string.  The function 're_search' does this.

   Before calling 're_search', you must compile your regular expression.
*Note GNU Regular Expression Compiling::.

   Here is the function declaration:

     int
     re_search (struct re_pattern_buffer *PATTERN_BUFFER,
                const char *STRING, const int SIZE,
                const int START, const int RANGE,
                struct re_registers *REGS)

whose arguments are the same as those to 're_match' (*note GNU
Matching::) except that the two arguments START and RANGE replace
're_match''s argument START.

   If RANGE is positive, then 're_search' attempts a match starting
first at index START, then at START + 1 if that fails, and so on, up to
START + RANGE; if RANGE is negative, then it attempts a match starting
first at index START, then at START -1 if that fails, and so on.

   If START is not between zero and SIZE, then 're_search' returns -1.
When RANGE is positive, 're_search' adjusts RANGE so that START + RANGE
- 1 is between zero and SIZE, if necessary; that way it won't search
outside of STRING.  Similarly, when RANGE is negative, 're_search'
adjusts RANGE so that START + RANGE + 1 is between zero and SIZE, if
necessary.

   If the 'fastmap' field of PATTERN_BUFFER is zero, 're_search' matches
starting at consecutive positions; otherwise, it uses 'fastmap' to make
the search more efficient.  *Note Searching with Fastmaps::.

   If no match is found, 're_search' returns -1.  If a match is found,
it returns the index where the match began.  If an internal error
happens, it returns -2.

16.7.1.5 Matching and Searching with Split Data
...............................................

   Using the functions 're_match_2' and 're_search_2', you can match or
search in data that is divided into two strings.

   The function:

     int
     re_match_2 (struct re_pattern_buffer *BUFFER,
                 const char *STRING1, const int SIZE1,
                 const char *STRING2, const int SIZE2,
                 const int START,
                 struct re_registers *REGS,
                 const int STOP)

is similar to 're_match' (*note GNU Matching::) except that you pass
_two_ data strings and sizes, and an index STOP beyond which you don't
want the matcher to try matching.  As with 're_match', if it succeeds,
're_match_2' returns how many characters of STRING it matched.  Regard
STRING1 and STRING2 as concatenated when you set the arguments START and
STOP and use the contents of REGS; 're_match_2' never returns a value
larger than SIZE1 + SIZE2.

   The function:

     int
     re_search_2 (struct re_pattern_buffer *BUFFER,
                  const char *STRING1, const int SIZE1,
                  const char *STRING2, const int SIZE2,
                  const int START, const int RANGE,
                  struct re_registers *REGS,
                  const int STOP)

is similarly related to 're_search'.

16.7.1.6 Searching with Fastmaps
................................

   If you're searching through a long string, you should use a fastmap.
Without one, the searcher tries to match at consecutive positions in the
string.  Generally, most of the characters in the string could not start
a match.  It takes much longer to try matching at a given position in
the string than it does to check in a table whether or not the character
at that position could start a match.  A "fastmap" is such a table.

   More specifically, a fastmap is an array indexed by the characters in
your character set.  Under the ASCII encoding, therefore, a fastmap has
256 elements.  If you want the searcher to use a fastmap with a given
pattern buffer, you must allocate the array and assign the array's
address to the pattern buffer's 'fastmap' field.  You either can compile
the fastmap yourself or have 're_search' do it for you; when 'fastmap'
is nonzero, it automatically compiles a fastmap the first time you
search using a particular compiled pattern.

   By setting the buffer's 'fastmap' field before calling
're_compile_pattern', you can reuse a buffer data structure across
multiple searches with different patterns, and allocate the fastmap only
once.  Nonetheless, the fastmap must be recompiled each time the buffer
has a new pattern compiled into it.

   To compile a fastmap yourself, use:

     int
     re_compile_fastmap (struct re_pattern_buffer *PATTERN_BUFFER)

PATTERN_BUFFER is the address of a pattern buffer.  If the character C
could start a match for the pattern, 're_compile_fastmap' makes
'PATTERN_BUFFER->fastmap[C]' nonzero.  It returns 0 if it can compile a
fastmap and -2 if there is an internal error.  For example, if '|' is
the alternation operator and PATTERN_BUFFER holds the compiled pattern
for 'a|b', then 're_compile_fastmap' sets 'fastmap['a']' and
'fastmap['b']' (and no others).

   're_search' uses a fastmap as it moves along in the string: it checks
the string's characters until it finds one that's in the fastmap.  Then
it tries matching at that character.  If the match fails, it repeats the
process.  So, by using a fastmap, 're_search' doesn't waste time trying
to match at positions in the string that couldn't start a match.

   If you don't want 're_search' to use a fastmap, store zero in the
'fastmap' field of the pattern buffer before calling 're_search'.

   Once you've initialized a pattern buffer's 'fastmap' field, you need
never do so again--even if you compile a new pattern in it--provided the
way the field is set still reflects whether or not you want a fastmap.
're_search' will still either do nothing if 'fastmap' is null or, if it
isn't, compile a new fastmap for the new pattern.

16.7.1.7 GNU Translate Tables
.............................

   If you set the 'translate' field of a pattern buffer to a translate
table, then the GNU Regex functions to which you've passed that pattern
buffer use it to apply a simple transformation to all the regular
expression and string characters at which they look.

   A "translate table" is an array indexed by the characters in your
character set.  Under the ASCII encoding, therefore, a translate table
has 256 elements.  The array's elements are also characters in your
character set.  When the Regex functions see a character C, they use
'translate[C]' in its place, with one exception: the character after a
'\' is not translated.  (This ensures that, the operators, e.g., '\B'
and '\b', are always distinguishable.)

   For example, a table that maps all lowercase letters to the
corresponding uppercase ones would cause the matcher to ignore
differences in case.(1)  Such a table would map all characters except
lowercase letters to themselves, and lowercase letters to the
corresponding uppercase ones.  Under the ASCII encoding, here's how you
could initialize such a table (we'll call it 'case_fold'):

     for (i = 0; i < 256; i++)
       case_fold[i] = i;
     for (i = 'a'; i <= 'z'; i++)
       case_fold[i] = i - ('a' - 'A');

   You tell Regex to use a translate table on a given pattern buffer by
assigning that table's address to the 'translate' field of that buffer.
If you don't want Regex to do any translation, put zero into this field.
You'll get weird results if you change the table's contents anytime
between compiling the pattern buffer, compiling its fastmap, and
matching or searching with the pattern buffer.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) A table that maps all uppercase letters to the corresponding
lowercase ones would work just as well for this purpose.

16.7.1.8 Using Registers
........................

   A group in a regular expression can match a (possibly empty)
substring of the string that regular expression as a whole matched.  The
matcher remembers the beginning and end of the substring matched by each
group.

   To find out what they matched, pass a nonzero REGS argument to a GNU
matching or searching function (*note GNU Matching:: and *note GNU
Searching::), i.e., the address of a structure of this type, as defined
in 'regex.h':

     struct re_registers
     {
       unsigned num_regs;
       regoff_t *start;
       regoff_t *end;
     };

   Except for (possibly) the NUM_REGS'th element (see below), the Ith
element of the 'start' and 'end' arrays records information about the
Ith group in the pattern.  (They're declared as C pointers, but this is
only because not all C compilers accept zero-length arrays;
conceptually, it is simplest to think of them as arrays.)

   The 'start' and 'end' arrays are allocated in one of two ways.  The
simplest and perhaps most useful is to let the matcher (re)allocate
enough space to record information for all the groups in the regular
expression.  If 're_set_registers' is not called before searching or
matching, then the matcher allocates two arrays each of 1 + RE_NSUB
elements (RE_NSUB is another field in the pattern buffer; *note GNU
Pattern Buffers::).  The extra element is set to -1.  Then on subsequent
calls with the same pattern buffer and REGS arguments, the matcher
reallocates more space if necessary.

   The function:

     void
     re_set_registers (struct re_pattern_buffer *BUFFER,
                       struct re_registers *REGS,
                       size_t NUM_REGS,
                       regoff_t *STARTS, regoff_t *ENDS)

sets REGS to hold NUM_REGS registers, storing them in STARTS and ENDS.
Subsequent matches using BUFFER and REGS will use this memory for
recording register information.  STARTS and ENDS must be allocated with
malloc, and must each be at least NUM_REGS * 'sizeof (regoff_t)' bytes
long.

   If NUM_REGS is zero, then subsequent matches should allocate their
own register data.

   Unless this function is called, the first search or match using
BUFFER will allocate its own register data, without freeing the old
data.

   The following examples illustrate the information recorded in the
're_registers' structure.  (In all of them, '(' represents the
open-group and ')' the close-group operator.  The first character in the
string STRING is at index 0.)

   * If the regular expression has an I-th group that matches a
     substring of STRING, then the function sets 'REGS->start[I]' to the
     index in STRING where the substring matched by the I-th group
     begins, and 'REGS->end[I]' to the index just beyond that
     substring's end.  The function sets 'REGS->start[0]' and
     'REGS->end[0]' to analogous information about the entire pattern.

     For example, when you match '((a)(b))' against 'ab', you get:

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[0]' and 2 in 'REGS->end[0]'

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[1]' and 2 in 'REGS->end[1]'

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[2]' and 1 in 'REGS->end[2]'

        * 1 in 'REGS->start[3]' and 2 in 'REGS->end[3]'

   * If a group matches more than once (as it might if followed by,
     e.g., a repetition operator), then the function reports the
     information about what the group _last_ matched.

     For example, when you match the pattern '(a)*' against the string
     'aa', you get:

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[0]' and 2 in 'REGS->end[0]'

        * 1 in 'REGS->start[1]' and 2 in 'REGS->end[1]'

   * If the I-th group does not participate in a successful match, e.g.,
     it is an alternative not taken or a repetition operator allows zero
     repetitions of it, then the function sets 'REGS->start[I]' and
     'REGS->end[I]' to -1.

     For example, when you match the pattern '(a)*b' against the string
     'b', you get:

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[0]' and 1 in 'REGS->end[0]'

        * -1 in 'REGS->start[1]' and -1 in 'REGS->end[1]'

   * If the I-th group matches a zero-length string, then the function
     sets 'REGS->start[I]' and 'REGS->end[I]' to the index just beyond
     that zero-length string.

     For example, when you match the pattern '(a*)b' against the string
     'b', you get:

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[0]' and 1 in 'REGS->end[0]'

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[1]' and 0 in 'REGS->end[1]'

   * If an I-th group contains a J-th group in turn not contained within
     any other group within group I and the function reports a match of
     the I-th group, then it records in 'REGS->start[J]' and
     'REGS->end[J]' the last match (if it matched) of the J-th group.

     For example, when you match the pattern '((a*)b)*' against the
     string 'abb', group 2 last matches the empty string, so you get
     what it previously matched:

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[0]' and 3 in 'REGS->end[0]'

        * 2 in 'REGS->start[1]' and 3 in 'REGS->end[1]'

        * 2 in 'REGS->start[2]' and 2 in 'REGS->end[2]'

     When you match the pattern '((a)*b)*' against the string 'abb',
     group 2 doesn't participate in the last match, so you get:

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[0]' and 3 in 'REGS->end[0]'

        * 2 in 'REGS->start[1]' and 3 in 'REGS->end[1]'

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[2]' and 1 in 'REGS->end[2]'

   * If an I-th group contains a J-th group in turn not contained within
     any other group within group I and the function sets
     'REGS->start[I]' and 'REGS->end[I]' to -1, then it also sets
     'REGS->start[J]' and 'REGS->end[J]' to -1.

     For example, when you match the pattern '((a)*b)*c' against the
     string 'c', you get:

        * 0 in 'REGS->start[0]' and 1 in 'REGS->end[0]'

        * -1 in 'REGS->start[1]' and -1 in 'REGS->end[1]'

        * -1 in 'REGS->start[2]' and -1 in 'REGS->end[2]'

16.7.1.9 Freeing GNU Pattern Buffers
....................................

   To free any allocated fields of a pattern buffer, use the POSIX
function 'regfree':

     void
     regfree (regex_t *PREG)

PREG is the pattern buffer whose allocated fields you want freed; this
works because since the type 'regex_t'--the type for POSIX pattern
buffers--is equivalent to the type 're_pattern_buffer'.

   'regfree' also sets PREG's 'allocated' field to zero.  After a buffer
has been freed, it must have a regular expression compiled in it before
passing it to a matching or searching function.

16.7.2 BSD Regex Functions
--------------------------

   If you're writing code that has to be Berkeley Unix compatible,
you'll need to use these functions whose interfaces are the same as
those in Berkeley Unix.

16.7.2.1 BSD Regular Expression Compiling
.........................................

   With Berkeley Unix, you can only search for a given regular
expression; you can't match one.  To search for it, you must first
compile it.  Before you compile it, you must indicate the regular
expression syntax you want it compiled according to by setting the
variable 're_syntax_options' (declared in 'regex.h' to some syntax
(*note Regular Expression Syntax::).

   To compile a regular expression use:

     char *
     re_comp (char *REGEX)

REGEX is the address of a null-terminated regular expression.  're_comp'
uses an internal pattern buffer, so you can use only the most recently
compiled pattern buffer.  This means that if you want to use a given
regular expression that you've already compiled--but it isn't the latest
one you've compiled--you'll have to recompile it.  If you call 're_comp'
with the null string (_not_ the empty string) as the argument, it
doesn't change the contents of the pattern buffer.

   If 're_comp' successfully compiles the regular expression, it returns
zero.  If it can't compile the regular expression, it returns an error
string.  're_comp''s error messages are identical to those of
're_compile_pattern' (*note GNU Regular Expression Compiling::).

16.7.2.2 BSD Searching
......................

   Searching the Berkeley Unix way means searching in a string starting
at its first character and trying successive positions within it to find
a match.  Once you've compiled a pattern using 're_comp' (*note BSD
Regular Expression Compiling::), you can ask Regex to search for that
pattern in a string using:

     int
     re_exec (char *STRING)

STRING is the address of the null-terminated string in which you want to
search.

   're_exec' returns either 1 for success or 0 for failure.  It
automatically uses a GNU fastmap (*note Searching with Fastmaps::).

16.8 Regular expression syntaxes
================================

   Gnulib supports many different types of regular expressions; although
the underlying features are the same or identical, the syntax used
varies.  The descriptions given here for the different types are
generated automatically.

16.8.1 'awk' regular expression syntax
--------------------------------------

   The character '.' matches any single character except the null
character.

'+'
     indicates that the regular expression should match one or more
     occurrences of the previous atom or regexp.
'?'
     indicates that the regular expression should match zero or one
     occurrence of the previous atom or regexp.
'\+'
     matches a '+'
'\?'
     matches a '?'.

   Bracket expressions are used to match ranges of characters.  Bracket
expressions where the range is backward, for example '[z-a]', are
invalid.  Within square brackets, '\' can be used to quote the following
character.  Character classes are supported; for example '[[:digit:]]'
will match a single decimal digit.

   GNU extensions are not supported and so '\w', '\W', '\<', '\>', '\b',
'\B', '\`', and '\'' match 'w', 'W', '<', '>', 'b', 'B', '`', and '''
respectively.

   Grouping is performed with parentheses '()'.  An unmatched ')'
matches just itself.  A backslash followed by a digit matches that
digit.

   The alternation operator is '|'.

   The characters '^' and '$' always represent the beginning and end of
a string respectively, except within square brackets.  Within brackets,
'^' can be used to invert the membership of the character class being
specified.

   '*', '+' and '?' are special at any point in a regular expression
except:

  1. At the beginning of a regular expression

  2. After an open-group, signified by '('
  3. After the alternation operator '|'

   The longest possible match is returned; this applies to the regular
expression as a whole and (subject to this constraint) to subexpressions
within groups.

16.8.2 'egrep' regular expression syntax
----------------------------------------

   The character '.' matches any single character.

'+'
     indicates that the regular expression should match one or more
     occurrences of the previous atom or regexp.
'?'
     indicates that the regular expression should match zero or one
     occurrence of the previous atom or regexp.
'\+'
     matches a '+'
'\?'
     matches a '?'.

   Bracket expressions are used to match ranges of characters.  Bracket
expressions where the range is backward, for example '[z-a]', are
invalid.  Within square brackets, '\' is taken literally.  Character
classes are supported; for example '[[:digit:]]' will match a single
decimal digit.

   GNU extensions are supported:

  1. '\w' matches a character within a word

  2. '\W' matches a character which is not within a word

  3. '\<' matches the beginning of a word

  4. '\>' matches the end of a word

  5. '\b' matches a word boundary

  6. '\B' matches characters which are not a word boundary

  7. '\`' matches the beginning of the whole input

  8. '\'' matches the end of the whole input

   Grouping is performed with parentheses '()'.  An unmatched ')'
matches just itself.  A backslash followed by a digit acts as a
back-reference and matches the same thing as the previous grouped
expression indicated by that number.  For example '\2' matches the
second group expression.  The order of group expressions is determined
by the position of their opening parenthesis '('.

   The alternation operator is '|'.

   The characters '^' and '$' always represent the beginning and end of
a string respectively, except within square brackets.  Within brackets,
'^' can be used to invert the membership of the character class being
specified.

   The characters '*', '+' and '?' are special anywhere in a regular
expression.

   Intervals are specified by '{' and '}'.  Invalid intervals are
treated as literals, for example 'a{1' is treated as 'a\{1'

   The longest possible match is returned; this applies to the regular
expression as a whole and (subject to this constraint) to subexpressions
within groups.

16.8.3 'ed' regular expression syntax
-------------------------------------

   The character '.' matches any single character except the null
character.

'\+'
     indicates that the regular expression should match one or more
     occurrences of the previous atom or regexp.
'\?'
     indicates that the regular expression should match zero or one
     occurrence of the previous atom or regexp.
'+ and ?'
     match themselves.

   Bracket expressions are used to match ranges of characters.  Bracket
expressions where the range is backward, for example '[z-a]', are
invalid.  Within square brackets, '\' is taken literally.  Character
classes are supported; for example '[[:digit:]]' will match a single
decimal digit.

   GNU extensions are supported:

  1. '\w' matches a character within a word

  2. '\W' matches a character which is not within a word

  3. '\<' matches the beginning of a word

  4. '\>' matches the end of a word

  5. '\b' matches a word boundary

  6. '\B' matches characters which are not a word boundary

  7. '\`' matches the beginning of the whole input

  8. '\'' matches the end of the whole input

   Grouping is performed with backslashes followed by parentheses '\(',
'\)'.  A backslash followed by a digit acts as a back-reference and
matches the same thing as the previous grouped expression indicated by
that number.  For example '\2' matches the second group expression.  The
order of group expressions is determined by the position of their
opening parenthesis '\('.

   The alternation operator is '\|'.

   The character '^' only represents the beginning of a string when it
appears:

  1. At the beginning of a regular expression

  2. After an open-group, signified by '\('

  3. After the alternation operator '\|'

   The character '$' only represents the end of a string when it
appears:

  1. At the end of a regular expression

  2. Before a close-group, signified by '\)'
  3. Before the alternation operator '\|'

   '\*', '\+' and '\?' are special at any point in a regular expression
except:

  1. At the beginning of a regular expression

  2. After an open-group, signified by '\('
  3. After the alternation operator '\|'

   Intervals are specified by '\{' and '\}'.  Invalid intervals such as
'a\{1z' are not accepted.

   The longest possible match is returned; this applies to the regular
expression as a whole and (subject to this constraint) to subexpressions
within groups.

16.8.4 'emacs' regular expression syntax
----------------------------------------

   The character '.' matches any single character except newline.

'+'
     indicates that the regular expression should match one or more
     occurrences of the previous atom or regexp.
'?'
     indicates that the regular expression should match zero or one
     occurrence of the previous atom or regexp.
'\+'
     matches a '+'
'\?'
     matches a '?'.

   Bracket expressions are used to match ranges of characters.  Bracket
expressions where the range is backward, for example '[z-a]', are
ignored.  Within square brackets, '\' is taken literally.  Character
classes are not supported, so for example you would need to use '[0-9]'
instead of '[[:digit:]]'.

   GNU extensions are supported:

  1. '\w' matches a character within a word

  2. '\W' matches a character which is not within a word

  3. '\<' matches the beginning of a word

  4. '\>' matches the end of a word

  5. '\b' matches a word boundary

  6. '\B' matches characters which are not a word boundary

  7. '\`' matches the beginning of the whole input

  8. '\'' matches the end of the whole input

   Grouping is performed with backslashes followed by parentheses '\(',
'\)'.  A backslash followed by a digit acts as a back-reference and
matches the same thing as the previous grouped expression indicated by
that number.  For example '\2' matches the second group expression.  The
order of group expressions is determined by the position of their
opening parenthesis '\('.

   The alternation operator is '\|'.

   The character '^' only represents the beginning of a string when it
appears:

  1. At the beginning of a regular expression

  2. After an open-group, signified by '\('

  3. After the alternation operator '\|'

   The character '$' only represents the end of a string when it
appears:

  1. At the end of a regular expression

  2. Before a close-group, signified by '\)'
  3. Before the alternation operator '\|'

   '*', '+' and '?' are special at any point in a regular expression
except:

  1. At the beginning of a regular expression

  2. After an open-group, signified by '\('
  3. After the alternation operator '\|'

   The longest possible match is returned; this applies to the regular
expression as a whole and (subject to this constraint) to subexpressions
within groups.

character.  Character classes are supported; for example '[[:digit:]]'
will match a single decimal digit.

   GNU extensions are not supported and so '\w', '\W', '\<', '\>', '\b',
'\B', '\`', and '\'' match 'w', 'W', '<', '>', 'b', 'B', '`', and '''
respectively.

   Grouping is performed with parentheses '()'.  An unmatched ')'
matches just itself.  A backslash followed by a digit acts as a
back-reference and matches the same thing as the previous grouped
expression indicated by that number.  For example '\2' matches the
second group expression.  The order of group expressions is determined
by the position of their opening parenthesis '('.

   The alternation operator is '|'.

   The characters '^' and '$' always represent the beginning and end of
a string respectively, except within square brackets.  Within brackets,
'^' can be used to invert the membership of the character class being
specified.

   '*', '+' and '?' are special at any point in a regular expression
except the following places, where they are not allowed:

  1. At the beginning of a regular expression

  2. After an open-group, signified by '('
  3. After the alternation operator '|'

   Intervals are specified by '{' and '}'.  Invalid intervals are
treated as literals, for example 'a{1' is treated as 'a\{1'

   The longest possible match is returned; this applies to the regular
expression as a whole and (subject to this constraint) to subexpressions
within groups.

17 Build Infrastructure Modules
*******************************

   Gnulib has a couple of modules that don't provide code, but rather
extend the GNU Build System.  That is, they are convenience facilities
for use with GNU Automake (in particular).

17.1 Searching for Libraries
============================

   The following macros check for the presence or location of certain C,
C++, or Fortran library archive files.

Simple Library Tests
--------------------

   The macros 'AC_CHECK_LIB', 'AC_SEARCH_LIBS' from GNU Autoconf check
for the presence of certain C, C++, or Fortran library archive files.
The libraries are looked up in the default linker path--a system
dependent list of directories, that usually contains the '/usr/lib'
directory--and those directories given by '-L' options in the 'LDFLAGS'
variable.

Locating Libraries
------------------

   The following macros, defined in the Gnulib module 'havelib', search
for the location of certain C, C++, or Fortran library archive files and
make the found location available to the compilation process and to
further Autoconf tests.

 -- Macro: 'AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS(NAME, [DEPENDENCIES])'

     Searches for 'lib<NAME>' and the libraries corresponding to
     explicit and implicit dependencies.  Sets and AC_SUBSTs the
     'LIB<NAME>' and 'LTLIB<NAME>' variables (with '<NAME>' in upper
     case) and augments the 'CPPFLAGS' variable by '-I' options.

     This macro should be used when 'lib<NAME>' is expected to be found.

 -- Macro: 'AC_LIB_HAVE_LINKFLAGS(NAME, [DEPENDENCIES], [INCLUDES],
          [TESTCODE], [MISSING-MESSAGE])'

     Searches for 'lib<NAME>' and the libraries corresponding to
     explicit and implicit dependencies, together with the specified
     include files and the ability to compile and link the specified
     TESTCODE.  The MISSING-MESSAGE defaults to 'no' and may contain
     additional hints for the user.  If found, it sets and AC_SUBSTs
     'HAVE_LIB<NAME>=yes' and the 'LIB<NAME>' and 'LTLIB<NAME>'
     variables (with '<NAME>' in upper case) and augments the 'CPPFLAGS'
     variable by '-I' options, and #defines 'HAVE_LIB<NAME>' to 1.
     Otherwise, it sets and AC_SUBSTs 'HAVE_LIB<NAME>=no' and
     'LIB<NAME>' and 'LTLIB<NAME>' to empty.

   These macros assume that when a library is installed in
'SOME_DIRECTORY/lib', its include files are installed in
'SOME_DIRECTORY/include'.

   The complexities that 'AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS' and 'AC_LIB_HAVE_LINKFLAGS'
deal with are the following:

   * The library is not necessarily already in the search path
     ('CPPFLAGS' for the include file search path, 'LDFLAGS' for the
     library search path).  The macro provides a '--with-lib<NAME>'
     option.  The user of the 'configure' script can use this option to
     indicate the location of the library and its include files.  If not
     provided, the '--prefix' directory is searched as well.

   * The library is not necessarily already in the run time library
     search path.  To avoid the need for setting an environment variable
     like 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH', the macro adds the appropriate run time
     search path options to the 'LIB<NAME>' variable.  This works on
     most systems.  It can also be inhibited: The user of 'configure'
     can use the '--disable-rpath' option to force an installation that
     doesn't contain hardcoded library search paths but instead may
     require the use of an environment variable like 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.

   The macros also set a variable 'LTLIB<NAME>', that should be used
when linking with libtool.  Both 'LTLIB<NAME>' and 'LIB<NAME>' contain
essentially the same option, but where 'LIB<NAME>' contains platform
dependent flags like '-Wl,-rpath', 'LTLIB<NAME>' contains platform
independent flags like '-R'.

   If you, by mistake, use 'LIB<NAME>' instead of 'LTLIB<NAME>' when
linking with libtool, you will observe that the binaries created in the
build dir will prefer the shared libraries in the installation
directories over the shared libraries in the build dir; this can lead to
all sorts of build failures, test failures, or crashes!

   If you, on the other hand, by mistake, use 'LTLIB<NAME>' instead of
'LIB<NAME>' when linking _without_ libtool, you will observe build
failures, because the '-R' options contained in 'LTLIB<NAME>' are not
valid options to compilers such as GCC.

Example of using 'AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS'
...................................

   Suppose you want to use 'libz', the compression library.

  1. In configure.ac you add the line

            AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([build-aux])
            AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS([z])

     Note that since the 'AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS' invocation modifies the
     CPPFLAGS, it should precede all tests that check for header files,
     declarations, structures or types.

  2. To the package's 'build-aux' directory you add the file
     'config.rpath', also part of the Gnulib 'havelib' module.
     ('gnulib-tool' will usually do this for you automatically.)

  3. In 'Makefile.in' you add '@LIBZ@' to the link command line of your
     program.  Or, if you are using Automake, you add '$(LIBZ)' to the
     'LDADD' variable that corresponds to your program.

Dependencies
............

   The dependencies list is a space separated list of library names that
'libNAME' is known to depend upon.  Example: If 'libfooy' depends on
'libfoox', and 'libfooz' depends on 'libfoox' and 'libfooy', you can
write:

     AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS([foox])
     AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS([fooy], [foox])
     AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS([fooz], [foox fooy])

Explicit dependencies are necessary if you cannot assume that a '.la'
file, created by libtool, is installed.  If you can assume that
'libfooy.la' is installed by libtool (and has not been omitted by the
package distributor!), you can omit the explicit dependency and just
write

     AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS([fooy])

This way, you don't need to know in advance which libraries the needed
library depends upon.

Static vs. shared
.................

   The macros find the libraries regardless whether they are installed
as shared or static libraries.

'CPPFLAGS' vs. 'LDFLAGS'
........................

   The macros determine the directories that should be added to the
compiler preprocessor's search path and to the linker's search path.
For the compiler preprocessor, '-I' options with the necessary
directories are added to the 'CPPFLAGS' variable, for use by the whole
package.  For the linker, appropriate options are added to the
'LIB<NAME>' and 'LTLIB<NAME>' variables, for use during linking by those
programs and libraries that need the dependency on 'lib<NAME>'.  You
need to use the value of 'LIB<NAME>' or 'LTLIB<NAME>' in the Makefiles.
'LTLIB<NAME>' is for use with libtool, whereas 'LIB<NAME>' is for when
libtool is not involved in linking.

   The macros do not check whether the include files and the library
found match.  If you want to verify this at configure time, one
technique is to have a version number in the include files and a version
number in the library, like this:
       #define LIBNAME_VERSION 10203
       extern int libNAME_version; /* initialized to LIBNAME_VERSION */
and use a test like
       AC_TRY_RUN([int main () { return libNAME_version != LIBNAME_VERSION; }])

Bi-arch systems
...............

   A bi-arch system is one where
   * the processor has a 32-bit execution mode and a 64-bit execution
     mode (for example, x86_64, ia64, sparc64, powerpc64), and
   * 32-bit mode libraries and executables and 64-bit mode libraries are
     both installed, and
   * 32-bit mode libraries and object files cannot be mixed with 64-bit
     mode ones.

   On several types of such systems, for historical reasons, the 32-bit
libraries are installed in 'PREFIX/lib', whereas the 64-bit libraries
are installed in
   * 'PREFIX/lib64' on many glibc systems,
   * 'PREFIX/lib/64' on Solaris systems.

   On such systems, in 64-bit mode, 'configure' will search for the
libraries in 'PREFIX/lib64' or 'PREFIX/lib/64', respectively, not in
'PREFIX/lib'.  A user can adhere to these system-wide conventions by
using the '--libdir' option when installing packages.  When a user has
already installed packages in 64-bit mode using the GNU default
'--libdir=PREFIX/lib', he can make this directory adhere to the
system-wide convention by placing a symbolic link:
On glibc systems:
     'ln -s lib PREFIX/lib64'
On Solaris systems:
     'ln -s . PREFIX/lib/64'

17.2 Controlling the Exported Symbols of Shared Libraries
=========================================================

   The 'lib-symbol-visibility' module allows precise control of the
symbols exported by a shared library.  This is useful because

   * It prevents abuse of undocumented APIs of your library.  Symbols
     that are not exported from the library cannot be used.  This
     eliminates the problem that when the maintainer of the library
     changes internals of the library, maintainers of other projects cry
     "breakage".  Instead, these maintainers are forced to negotiate the
     desired API from the maintainer of the library.

   * It reduces the risk of symbol collision between your library and
     other libraries.  For example, the symbol 'readline' is defined in
     several libraries, most of which don't have the same semantics and
     the same calling convention as the GNU readline library.

   * It reduces the startup time of programs linked to the library.
     This is because the dynamic loader has less symbols to process.

   * It allows the compiler to generate better code.  Within a shared
     library, a call to a function that is a global symbol costs a
     "call" instruction to a code location in the so-called PLT
     (procedure linkage table) which contains a "jump" instruction to
     the actual function's code.  (This is needed so that the function
     can be overridden, for example by a function with the same name in
     the executable or in a shared library interposed with
     'LD_PRELOAD'.)  Whereas a call to a function for which the compiler
     can assume that it is in the same shared library is just a direct
     "call" instructions.  Similarly for variables: A reference to a
     global variable fetches a pointer in the so-called GOT (global
     offset table); this is a pointer to the variable's memory.  So the
     code to access it is two memory load instructions.  Whereas for a
     variable which is known to reside in the same shared library, it is
     just a direct memory access: one memory load instruction.

   There are traditionally three ways to specify the exported symbols of
a shared library.

   * The programmer specifies the list of symbols to be exported when
     the shared library is created.  Usually a command-line option is
     passed to the linker, with the name of a file containing the
     symbols.

     The upside of this approach is flexibility: it allows the same code
     to be used in different libraries with different export lists.  The
     downsides are: 1.  it's a lot of maintenance overhead when the
     symbol list is platform dependent, 2.  it doesn't work well with
     C++, due to name mangling.

   * The programmer specifies a "hidden" attribute for every variable
     and function that shall not be exported.

     The drawbacks of this approach are: Symbols are still exported from
     the library by default.  It's a lot of maintenance work to mark
     every non- exported variable and function.  But usually the
     exported API is quite small, compared to the internal API of the
     library.  And it's the wrong paradigm: It doesn't force thinking
     when introducing new exported API.

   * The programmer specifies a "hidden" attribute for all files that
     make up the shared library, and an "exported" attribute for those
     symbols in these files that shall be exported.

     This is perfect: It burdens the maintainer only for exported API,
     not for library-internal API.  And it keeps the annotations in the
     source code.

   GNU libtool's '-export-symbols' option implements the first approach.
The script 'declared.sh' from Gnulib can help to produce the list of
symbols.

   This gnulib module implements the third approach.  For this it relies
on GNU GCC 4.0 or newer, namely on its '-fvisibility=hidden'
command-line option and the "visibility" attribute.  (The "visibility"
attribute was already supported in GCC 3.4, but without the command line
option, introduced in GCC 4.0, the third approach could not be used.)

   More explanations on this subject can be found in
<https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility>, which contains more details on
the GCC features and additional advice for C++ libraries, and in Ulrich
Drepper's paper <https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf>, which
also explains other tricks for reducing the startup time impact of
shared libraries.

   The gnulib autoconf macro 'gl_VISIBILITY' tests for GCC 4.0 or newer.
It defines a Makefile variable '@CFLAG_VISIBILITY@' containing
'-fvisibility=hidden' or nothing.  It also defines as a C macro and as a
substituted variable: @HAVE_VISIBILITY@.  Its value is 1 when symbol
visibility control is supported, and 0 otherwise.

   To use this module in a library, say libfoo, you will do these steps:

  1. Add '@CFLAG_VISIBILITY@' or (in a Makefile.am)
     '$(CFLAG_VISIBILITY)' to the CFLAGS for the compilation of the
     sources that make up the library.

  2. Add a C macro definition, say '-DBUILDING_LIBFOO', to the CPPFLAGS
     for the compilation of the sources that make up the library.

  3. Define a macro specific to your library like this.
          #if BUILDING_LIBFOO && HAVE_VISIBILITY
          #define LIBFOO_DLL_EXPORTED __attribute__((__visibility__("default")))
          #else
          #define LIBFOO_DLL_EXPORTED
          #endif
     This macro should be enabled in all public header files of your
     library.

  4. Annotate all variable, function and class declarations in all
     public header files of your library with 'LIBFOO_DLL_EXPORTED'.
     This annotation can occur at different locations: between the
     'extern' and the type or return type, or just before the entity
     being declared, or after the entire declarator.  My preference is
     to put it right after 'extern', so that the declarations in the
     header files remain halfway readable.

   Note that the precise control of the exported symbols will not work
with other compilers than GCC >= 4.0, and will not work on systems where
the assembler or linker lack the support of "hidden" visibility.
Therefore, it's good if, in order to reduce the risk of collisions with
symbols in other libraries, you continue to use a prefix specific to
your library for all non-static variables and functions and for all C++
classes in your library.

   Note about other compilers: MSVC support can be added easily, by
extending the definition of the macro mentioned above, to something like
this:
     #if BUILDING_LIBFOO && HAVE_VISIBILITY
     #define LIBFOO_DLL_EXPORTED __attribute__((__visibility__("default")))
     #elif BUILDING_LIBFOO && defined _MSC_VER
     #define LIBFOO_DLL_EXPORTED __declspec(dllexport)
     #elif defined _MSC_VER
     #define LIBFOO_DLL_EXPORTED __declspec(dllimport)
     #else
     #define LIBFOO_DLL_EXPORTED
     #endif

17.3 LD Version Scripts
=======================

   The 'lib-symbol-versions' module can be used to add shared library
versioning support.  Currently, only GNU LD and the Solaris linker
supports this.

   Version scripts provides information that can be used by GNU/Linux
distribution packaging tools.  For example, Debian has a tool
'dpkg-shlibdeps' that can determine the minimal required version of each
dependency (by looking at the symbol list) and stuff the information
into the Debian specific packaging files.

   For more information and other uses of version scripts, see Ulrich
Drepper's paper <https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf>

   You use the module by importing it to your library, and then add the
following lines to the 'Makefile.am' that builds the library:

     if HAVE_LD_VERSION_SCRIPT
     libfoo_la_LDFLAGS += -Wl,--version-script=$(srcdir)/libfoo.map
     endif

   The version script file format is documented in the GNU LD manual,
but a small example would be:

     LIBFOO_1.0 {
       global:
         libfoo_init; libfoo_doit; libfoo_done;

       local:
         *;
     };

   If you target platforms that do not support linker scripts (i.e., all
platforms that doesn't use GNU LD) you may want to consider a more
portable but less powerful alternative: libtool '-export-symbols'.  It
will hide internal symbols from your library, but will not add ELF
versioning symbols.  Your usage would then be something like:

     if HAVE_LD_VERSION_SCRIPT
     libfoo_la_LDFLAGS += -Wl,--version-script=$(srcdir)/libfoo.map
     else
     libfoo_la_LDFLAGS += -export-symbols $(srcdir)/libfoo.sym
     endif

   See the Libtool manual for the file syntax, but a small example would
be:

     libfoo_init
     libfoo_doit
     libfoo_done

   To avoid the need for a '*.sym' file if your symbols are easily
expressed using a regular expression, you may use
'-export-symbols-regex':

     if HAVE_LD_VERSION_SCRIPT
     libfoo_la_LDFLAGS += -Wl,--version-script=$(srcdir)/libfoo.map
     else
     libfoo_la_LDFLAGS += -export-symbols-regex '^libfoo_.*'
     endif

   For more discussions about symbol visibility, rather than shared
library versioning, see the 'visibility' module (*note Exported Symbols
of Shared Libraries::).

17.4 configmake
===============

   The 'configmake' module builds a C include file named 'configmake.h'
containing the usual installation directory values; for example, those
specified by '--prefix' or '--libdir' to configure.  Each variable is
given a '#define' with an all-uppercase macro name, such as 'PREFIX' and
'LIBDIR'.  (Automake cannot create this file directly because the user
might override directory values at 'make' time.)

   Specifically, the module retrieves values of the variables through
'configure' followed by 'make', not directly through 'configure', so
that a user who sets some of these variables consistently on the 'make'
command line gets correct results.

   One advantage of this approach, compared to the classical approach of
adding '-DLIBDIR=\"$(libdir)\"' etc. to 'AM_CPPFLAGS', is that it
protects against the use of undefined variables.  That is, if, say,
'$(libdir)' is not set in the Makefile, 'LIBDIR' is not defined by this
module, and code using 'LIBDIR' gives a compilation error.

   Another advantage is that 'make' output is shorter.

   For the complete list of variables which are '#define'd this way, see
the file 'gnulib/modules/configmake', or inspect your resulting gnulib
Makefile.

17.5 warnings
=============

   The 'warnings' module allows to regularly build a package with more
GCC warnings than the default warnings emitted by GCC.

   It provides the following functionality:

   * You can select some warning options, such as '-Wall', to be enabled
     whenever building with a GCC version that supports these options.
     The user can choose to override these warning options by providing
     the opposite options in the 'CFLAGS' variable at configuration
     time.

   * You can make these warnings apply to selected directories only.  In
     projects where subprojects are maintained by different people, or
     where parts of the source code are imported from external sources
     (for example from gnulib), it is useful to apply different warning
     options to different directories.

   * It lets you use '-Werror' at 'make distcheck' time, to verify that
     on the maintainer's system, no warnings remain.  (Note that use of
     '-Werror' in 'CFLAGS' does not work in general, because it may
     break autoconfiguration.)

   * Similarly, it lets you use '-Werror' when the builder runs
     'configure' with an option such as '--enable-gcc-warnings'.

   To use this module, you need the following:

  1. In 'configure.ac', use for example
          gl_WARN_ADD([-Wall], [WARN_CFLAGS])
          gl_WARN_ADD([-Wpointer-arith], [WARN_CFLAGS])

  2. In the directories which shall use 'WARN_CFLAGS', use it in the
     definition of 'AM_CFLAGS', like this:
          AM_CFLAGS = $(WARN_CFLAGS)

     Note that the 'AM_CFLAGS' is used in combination with 'CFLAGS' and
     before 'CFLAGS' in build rules emitted by Automake.  This allows
     the user to provide 'CFLAGS' that override the 'WARN_CFLAGS'.

   'gl_WARN_ADD([-Werror])' is intended for developers, and should be
avoided in contexts where it would affect ordinary installation builds.
The warnings emitted by GCC depend, to some extent, on the contents of
the system header files, on the size and signedness of built-in types,
etc.  Use of '-Werror' would cause frustration to all users on platforms
that the maintainer has not tested before the release.  It is better if
'-Werror' is off by default, and is enabled only by developers.  For
example, '-Werror' could affect 'make distcheck' or 'configure
--enable-gcc-warnings' as mentioned above.

17.6 manywarnings
=================

   The 'manywarnings' module allows you to enable as many GCC warnings
as possible for your package.  The purpose is to protect against
introducing new code that triggers warnings that weren't already
triggered by the existing code base.

   An example use of the module is as follows:

     gl_MANYWARN_ALL_GCC([warnings])
     # Set up the list of the pointless, undesired warnings.
     nw=
     nw="$nw -Wsystem-headers"       # Don't let system headers trigger warnings
     nw="$nw -Wundef"                # All compiler preprocessors support #if UNDEF
     nw="$nw -Wtraditional"          # All compilers nowadays support ANSI C
     nw="$nw -Wconversion"           # These warnings usually don't point to mistakes.
     nw="$nw -Wsign-conversion"      # Likewise.
     # Enable all GCC warnings not in this list.
     gl_MANYWARN_COMPLEMENT([warnings], [$warnings], [$nw])
     for w in $warnings; do
       gl_WARN_ADD([$w])
     done

   This module is meant to be used by developers who are not very
experienced regarding the various GCC warning options.  In the beginning
you will set the list of undesired warnings ('nw' in the example above)
to empty, and compile the package with all possible warnings enabled.
The GCC option '-fdiagnostics-show-option', available in GCC 4.1 or
newer, helps understanding which warnings originated from which option.
Then you will go through the list of warnings.  You will likely
deactivate warnings that occur often and don't point to mistakes in the
code, by adding them to the 'nw' variable, then reconfiguring and
recompiling.  When warnings point to real mistakes and bugs in the code,
you will of course not disable them.

   There are also many GCC warning options which usually don't point to
mistakes in the code; these warnings enforce a certain programming
style.  It is a project management decision whether you want your code
to follow any of these styles.  Note that some of these programming
styles are conflicting.  You cannot have them all; you have to choose
among them.

   When a new version of GCC is released, you can add the new warning
options that it introduces into the 'gl_MANYWARN_ALL_GCC' macro (and
submit your modification to the Gnulib maintainers :-)), and enjoy the
benefits of the new warnings, while adding the undesired ones to the
'nw' variable.

17.7 Running self-tests under valgrind
======================================

   For projects written in C or similar languages, running the
self-tests under Valgrind can reveal hard to find memory issues.  Gnulib
supports two ways to make use of Valgrind: one that enables use of
Valgrind at configure time, when 'configure' found it to be present; and
one at the discretion of the developer.

17.7.1 Using valgrind without developer intervention
----------------------------------------------------

   The 'valgrind-tests' module searches for Valgrind at configure time
and declares the 'VALGRIND' automake variable for use with automake's
'TESTS_ENVIRONMENT'.

   After importing the 'valgrind-tests' module to your project, you use
it by adding the following to the 'Makefile.am' that runs the
self-tests:

     TESTS_ENVIRONMENT = $(VALGRIND)

   This will run all self-checks under valgrind.

17.7.2 Using valgrind at the developer's discretion
---------------------------------------------------

   In this approach, you define a 'Makefile.am' variable 'VALGRIND' (or,
more abstractly, 'CHECKER'), that is usually set to empty.  When you
have configured and built the package and you decide that you want to
run the tests with valgrind, you do so by modifying the definition of
'VALGRIND' in the Makefile.

17.7.3 How to use Valgrind with shell scripts
---------------------------------------------

   It is not desirable to apply valgrind to shell scripts or other
non-binaries, because
   * It is wasteful, and you usually don't want to look for memory leaks
     in bash.
   * On a bi-arch system, you may get an error message such as
     "valgrind: wrong executable class (eg.  32-bit instead of 64-bit)".

   There are two ways to avoid this:

   * You can make use of the 'build-aux/run-test' script from Gnulib.
     Add these lines to your 'Makefile.am':

          # This must be the last thing that gets added to TESTS_ENVIRONMENT.
          TESTS_ENVIRONMENT += $(SHELL) $(top_srcdir)/build-aux/run-test '$(VALGRIND)'

   * Using the Automake parallel-tests feature, you can use the
     following instead:

          AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = parallel-tests
          TEST_EXTENSIONS = .pl .sh
          LOG_COMPILER = $(VALGRIND)

     Then valgrind will only be used for the non-.sh and non-.pl tests.

   However, with this measure in place, binaries invoked through scripts
will not be invoked under valgrind.  This can be solved by defining
environment variables in the 'TESTS_ENVIRONMENT' variable that are then
used by the shell scripts.  For example, add the following:

     TESTS_ENVIRONMENT = VALGRIND='$(VALGRIND)'

   And then modify the shell scripts to invoke the binary prefixed with
'$VALGRIND'.

17.8 VCS To ChangeLog
=====================

   Gnulib provides the 'vcs-to-changelog' module to generate an output
similar to the GNU ChangeLog format from metadata of source control
software such as git.  Here's an example of using 'vcs-to-changelog':

     build-aux/vcs-to-changelog.py <from_ref> <to_ref>

   where '<from_ref>' and '<to_ref>' refer to the range of commits to
generate the output.

   VCS To ChangeLog currently recognises changes in C source code and
can traverse commits in git.  Additional source frontends and source
control backends may be added to the module.  'vcs-to-changelog' takes
the following optional arguments:

   * '-d': Run the parser debugger, used for debugging
     'vcs-to-changelog'
   * '-q filename': Load FILENAME as the quirks file for the project.

   The quirks file is a python module that must minimally implement a
'get_project_quirks' function that returns an object of type
'ProjectQuirks' or its subclass.  The subclass may override the
following members of 'ProjectQuirks':

   * 'repo': Specify the project repo source control.  The default value
     is 'git'.

   * 'IGNORE_LIST': A list of files to ignore in the changesets, either
     because they are not needed (such as the ChangeLog) or because they
     are not parseable.  For example, the GNU C Library has a header
     file that is only assembly code, which breaks the C parser.

   * 'MACRO_QUIRKS': A list of dictionary entries with indexes as 'orig'
     and 'sub' where 'orig' is a Python regular expression pattern to
     match and 'sub' is the substitution.  These substitutions are used
     to work around C/C++ macros that are known to break parsing of C
     programs.

   * 'C_MACROS': This is a list of C preprocessor macro definitions that
     are extensively used and are known to break parsing due to some
     characteristic, mainly the lack of a semicolon at the end.

18 Build Infrastructure Files
*****************************

   Gnulib contains also a small number of files that are not part of
modules.  They are meant to be imported into packages by means of
'gnulib-tool --copy-file', not 'gnulib-tool --import'.  For example, the
commands to import the files 'config.guess' and 'config.sub' are
     for file in config.guess config.sub; do
       $GNULIB_TOOL --copy-file build-aux/$file \
         && chmod a+x build-aux/$file \
         || exit $?
     done

   Packages that don't use Gnulib can get hold of these files through
direct download from Gnulib's git repository.  The commands to do this
look as follows:
     for file in config.guess config.sub; do
       echo "$0: getting $file..."
       wget -q --timeout=5 -O build-aux/$file.tmp "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob_plain;f=build-aux/${file};hb=HEAD" \
         && mv build-aux/$file.tmp build-aux/$file \
         && chmod a+x build-aux/$file
       retval=$?
       rm -f build-aux/$file.tmp
       test $retval -eq 0 || exit $retval
     done

18.1 Recognizing platforms
==========================

'build-aux/config.guess'
'build-aux/config.sub'
     These files are helper scripts, invoked by the 'configure' script.
     'config.guess' recognizes the platform on which the script is
     running, and produces a triplet of the form
     'CPU-TYPE-VENDOR-OPERATING_SYSTEM'.  'config.sub' receives a
     possibly abbreviated triplet and produces a canonical triplet for a
     platform.  For more information, see *note
     (standards)Configuration::.

   It is important that you always include the newest versions of these
two files in your tarball, because people who work on emerging platforms
otherwise have a hard time building your package.

18.2 Utilities for Makefiles
============================

   These are a couple of programs that are often useful in Makefiles.
Some of them are also described in *note (automake)Auxiliary Programs::.

'build-aux/ar-lib'
'build-aux/compile'
     These two scripts are necessary for supporting portability to
     native Windows with the MSVC compiler.  'compile' is a wrapper
     script that invokes the compiler and provides a command-line
     interface compatible with Unix compilers.  Similarly, 'ar-lib' is a
     wrapper script that provides a command-line interface compatible
     with Unix 'ar'.
'build-aux/depcomp'
     This is a helper script, used by Makefile rules generated by GNU
     Automake.  It generates Makefile dependencies while compiling a
     file.
'build-aux/install-sh'
     This is a helper script, used by Makefile rules generated by GNU
     Automake.  It installs files during the 'make install' phase.  In
     the Makefile, don't use this file directly; always use
     '$(INSTALL_PROGRAM)' or '$(INSTALL_DATA)' instead.
'build-aux/mdate-sh'
     This script determines the modification time of a file and
     pretty-prints it.  The typical use is to add a "Last modified" line
     to the documentation.
'build-aux/mkinstalldirs'
     This is a helper script, used by Makefile rules generated by GNU
     Automake.  It creates directories during the 'make install' phase.
     It is roughly equivalent to 'mkdir -p' (except that the latter is
     not portable).  In the Makefile, don't use this file directly;
     always use '$(MKDIR_P)' instead.
'build-aux/mktempd'
     This script creates a temporary directory.  It is roughly
     equivalent to 'mktemp -d' (except that the latter is not portable).
'build-aux/move-if-change'
     This script moves a freshly generated file to a destination file,
     with a special optimization for the case that both files are
     identical.  In this case the freshly generated file is deleted, and
     the time stamp of the destination file is _not_ changed.  This is
     useful when updating a file that rarely actually changes and which
     many Makefile targets depend upon.

18.3 Programs for developing in Git checkouts
=============================================

   These are a couple of programs that help when developing in a Git
checkout.  The maintainer of the package copies these programs into the
version control of the package, so that co-developers can use these
tools right away.

'top/gitsub.sh'
     This program manages the subdirectories of a Git checkout that come
     from other packages, including Gnulib.
'build-aux/bootstrap'
     This program manages the Git submodules, including Gnulib, and is
     also a wrapper around 'gnulib-tool' and 'automake', that generates
     files from other files.
     Note: Because this program mixes version control management and
     generation of files in non-obvious ways, it has a number of
     usability issues for the advanced developer.
'build-aux/bootstrap.conf'
     This is the template configuration file.  After copying it into
     your package, you need to customize it.
'build-aux/po/Makefile.in.in'
'build-aux/po/remove-potcdate.sin'
     These are auxiliary files used by 'bootstrap'.  You don't have to
     copy them yourself; 'bootstrap' will do that.

18.4 Utilities for building documentation
=========================================

   These are auxiliary files for building documentation.

'build-aux/texinfo.tex'
     This file is needed for the conversion of Texinfo-format
     documentation to PDF, PostScript, or DVI formats.  It implements
     the GNU Texinfo commands on top of plain TeX.
'build-aux/x-to-1.in'
     This file, once processed, gives a program 'x-to-1', that produces
     a manual page for a program, by combining a skeleton with the
     program's '--help' output.

18.5 Utilities for building libraries
=====================================

'build-aux/declared.sh'
     This program extracts the declared global symbols of a C header
     file.  It is useful when you want to control the set of symbols
     exported by a library.  See *note Exported Symbols of Shared
     Libraries::.

18.6 Utilities for running test suites
======================================

'build-aux/run-test'
     This file is a test driver that supports running a test under
     'valgrind'.
'build-aux/test-driver.diff'
     This is a patch, against Automake's test driver, that support
     running a test suite on Android.

19 Release Management Files
***************************

   Gnulib also contain a few scripts that are useful for the release
management of a package.  They can be used directly off the Gnulib
checkout; they don't need to copied first.

19.1 Tools for releasing packages with shared libraries
=======================================================

'build-aux/libtool-next-version'
     This program is a wizard that helps a maintainer update the libtool
     version of a shared library, without making mistakes in this
     process.  For background documentation, see *note (libtool)Updating
     version info::.

19.2 Tools for uploading release tarballs
=========================================

'build-aux/gnupload'
     This program is a user-friendly way to upload a release tarball to
     one of the GNU servers ('ftp.gnu.org' or 'alpha.gnu.org').  It
     implements the interface described in *note (maintain)Automated FTP
     Uploads::.
'build-aux/ncftpput-ftp'
     This is a helper program that mimics the 'ncftpput' program used by
     'gnupload'.  If you want to use 'gnupload' but don't have 'ncftp'
     installed, copy this file into your $PATH, renaming it to
     'ncftpput'.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
